Today I &apos;m going to speak to you about the last 30 years of architectural history .
That &apos;s a lot to pack into 18 minutes .
It &apos;s a complex topic , so we &apos;re just going to dive right in at a complex place : New Jersey .
Because 30 years ago , I &apos;m from Jersey , and I was six , and I lived there in my parents &apos; house in a town called Li@@ v@@ ing@@ ston , and this was my childhood bedroom .
Around the corner from my bedroom was the bathroom that I used to share with my sister .
And in between my bedroom and the bathroom was a balcon@@ y that over@@ looked the family room .
And that &apos;s where everyone would hang out and watch TV , so that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom , everyone would see me , and every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel , everyone would see me .
And I looked like this .
I was awkward , insecure , and I hated it .
I hated that walk , I hated that balcon@@ y , I hated that room , and I hated that house .
And that &apos;s architecture .
That feeling , those emotions that I felt , that &apos;s the power of architecture , because architecture is not about math and it &apos;s not about z@@ oning , it &apos;s about those visceral , emotional connections that we feel to the places that we occupy .
And it &apos;s no surprise that we feel that way , because according to the E@@ PA , Americans spend 90 percent of their time indoors .
That &apos;s 90 percent of our time surrounded by architecture .
That &apos;s huge .
That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn &apos;t even realize .
That makes us a little bit g@@ ul@@ li@@ ble and very , very predictable .
It means that when I show you a building like this , I know what you think : You think &quot; power &quot; and &quot; stability &quot; and &quot; democracy . &quot;
And I know you think that because it &apos;s based on a building that was build 2,@@ 500 years ago by the Greeks .
This is a trick .
This is a trigger that architects use to get you to create an emotional connection to the forms that we build our buildings out of .
It &apos;s a predictable emotional connection , and we &apos;ve been using this trick for a long , long time .
We used it &#91; 200 &#93; years ago to build banks .
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums .
And in the 20th century in America , we used it to build houses .
And look at these solid , stable little soldiers facing the ocean and keeping away the elements .
This is really , really useful , because building things is terrifying .
It &apos;s expensive , it takes a long time , and it &apos;s very complicated .
And the people that build things -- developers and governments -- they &apos;re naturally afraid of innovation , and they &apos;d rather just use those forms that they know you &apos;ll respond to .
That &apos;s how we end up with buildings like this .
This is a nice building .
But it doesn &apos;t have much to do with what a library actually does today .
That same year , in 2004 , on the other side of the country , another library was completed , and it looks like this .
It &apos;s in Seattle .
This library is about how we consume media in a digital age .
It &apos;s about a new kind of public am@@ en@@ ity for the city , a place to gather and read and share .
So how is it possible that in the same year , in the same country , two buildings , both called libraries , look so completely different ?
And the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pend@@ ul@@ um .
On the one side is innovation , and architects are constantly pushing , pushing for new technologies , new typ@@ ologies , new solutions for the way that we live today .
We wear all black , we get very depressed , you think we &apos;re ad@@ orable , we &apos;re dead inside because we &apos;ve got no choice .
We have to go to the other side and re@@ engage those symbols that we know you love .
So we do that , and you &apos;re happy , we feel like s@@ ell@@ outs , so we start experimenting again and we push the pend@@ ul@@ um back and back and forth and back and forth we &apos;ve gone for the last 300 years , and certainly for the last 30 years .
Okay , 30 years ago we were coming out of the &apos; 70s .
Archit@@ ects had been busy experimenting with something called brut@@ alism .
It &apos;s about concrete .
Small windows , de@@ human@@ izing scale .
This is really tough stuff .
So as we get closer to the &apos; 80s , we start to re@@ engage those symbols .
We push the pend@@ ul@@ um back into the other direction .
We take these forms that we know you love and we update them .
We add ne@@ on and we add pa@@ st@@ els and we use new materials .
And you love it .
And we can &apos;t give you enough of it .
We take Chi@@ pp@@ end@@ ale ar@@ mo@@ ires and we turned those into skyscrap@@ ers , and skyscrap@@ ers can be medi@@ eval cast@@ les made out of glass .
For@@ ms got big , forms got bold and colorful .
D@@ war@@ ves became columns .
It was crazy .
But it &apos;s the &apos; 80s , it &apos;s cool .
This is the thing about post@@ moder@@ nis@@ m .
This is the thing about symbols .
They &apos;re easy , they &apos;re cheap , because instead of making places , we &apos;re making memories of places .
Because I know , and I know all of you know , this isn &apos;t T@@ us@@ c@@ any .
This is Ohio .
In the late &apos; 80s and early &apos; 90s , we start experimenting with something called de@@ construc@@ tivism .
We throw out historical symbols , we rely on new , computer-@@ ai@@ ded design techniques , and we come up with new compos@@ i@@ tions , forms crashing into forms .
This is academic and head@@ y stuff , it &apos;s super un@@ popular , we totally alien@@ ate you .
Or@@ din@@ arily , the pend@@ ul@@ um would just swing back into the other direction .
And then , something amazing happened .
In 1997 , this building opened .
This is the Gu@@ g@@ gen@@ heim Bil@@ bao , by Frank Gehry .
And this building fundamentally changes the world &apos;s relationship to architecture .
Paul Gold@@ ber@@ ger said that Bil@@ bao was one of those rare moments when cri@@ tics , academics , and the general public were completely united around a building .
The New York Times called this building a miracle .
Tour@@ ism in Bil@@ bao increased 2,@@ 500 percent after this building was completed .
He is our very first star@@ ch@@ it@@ ect .
Now , how is it possible that these forms -- they &apos;re wild and radical -- how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world ?
And it happened because media so successfully gal@@ van@@ ized around them that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism .
We created an emotional reaction to these forms .
So did every mayor in the world .
So every mayor knew that if they had these forms , they had culture and tourism .
This phenomenon at the turn of the new millenni@@ um happened to a few other star@@ ch@@ it@@ ects .
Because think about how you consume architecture .
A thousand years ago , you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building .
Transpor@@ tation speeds up : You can take a boat , you can take a plane , you can be a tour@@ ist .
Technology speeds up : You can see it in a newspaper , on TV , until finally , we are all architectural photographers , and the building has become dis@@ embodied from the site .
Archit@@ ec@@ ture is everywhere now , and that means that the speed of communication has finally caught up to the speed of architecture .
Because architecture actually moves quite quickly .
It doesn &apos;t take long to think about a building .
It takes a long time to build a building , three or four years , and in the inter@@ im , an architect will design two or eight or a hundred other buildings before they know if that building that they designed four years ago was a success or not .
That &apos;s because there &apos;s never been a good feedback loop in architecture .
That &apos;s how we end up with buildings like this .
It &apos;s never going to happen again , I think , because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concrete , of steel , or of the elevator , and it &apos;s a media revolution .
So my theory is that when you apply media to this pend@@ ul@@ um , it starts sw@@ inging faster and faster , until it &apos;s at both extremes nearly simultaneously , and that effectively bl@@ urs the difference between innovation and symbol , between us , the architects , and you , the public .
Now we can make nearly inst@@ ant@@ ane@@ ous , emotionally charged symbols out of something that &apos;s brand new .
Let me show you how this plays out in a project that my firm recently completed .
We were hired to replace this building , which burned down .
This is the center of a town called the P@@ ines in Fir@@ e Island in New York State .
It &apos;s a vacation community .
We proposed a building that was aud@@ acious , that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to , and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared , so we created a series of phot@@ ore@@ alistic ren@@ der@@ ings that we put onto Facebook and we put onto Inst@@ ag@@ ram , and we let people start to do what they do : share it , comment , like it , hate it .
But that meant that two years before the building was complete , it was already a part of the community , so that when the ren@@ der@@ ings looked exactly like the finished product , there were no surprises .
This building was already a part of this community , and then that first summer , when people started arri@@ ving and sharing the building on social media , the building c@@ eased to be just an edi@@ f@@ ice and it became media , because these , these are not just pictures of a building , they &apos;re your pictures of a building .
That means we don &apos;t need the Greeks anymore to tell us what to think about architecture .
We can tell each other what we think about architecture , because digital media hasn &apos;t just changed the relationship between all of us , it &apos;s changed the relationship between us and buildings .
Think for a second about those libr@@ arians back in Li@@ v@@ ing@@ ston .
If that building was going to be built today , the first thing they would do is go online and search &quot; new libraries . &quot;
They would be bombar@@ ded by examples of experim@@ entation , of innovation , of pushing at the envelope of what a library can be .
That &apos;s amm@@ uni@@ tion .
That &apos;s amm@@ uni@@ tion that they can take with them to the mayor of Li@@ v@@ ing@@ ston , to the people of Li@@ v@@ ing@@ ston , and say , there &apos;s no one answer to what a library is today .
Let &apos;s be a part of this .
This abundance of experim@@ entation gives them the freedom to run their own experiment .
Everything is different now .
Archit@@ ects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use big words and complicated drawings , and you aren &apos;t the hap@@ less public , the consumer that won &apos;t accept anything that they haven &apos;t seen anymore .
Archit@@ ects can hear you , and you &apos;re not intim@@ i@@ dated by architecture .
This is the end of architectural history , and it means that the buildings of tomorrow are going to look a lot different than the buildings of today .
It means that a public space in the ancient city of S@@ ev@@ ille can be unique and tail@@ ored to the way that a modern city works .
It means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be a stadium in Brooklyn , not some red-@@ brick historical pa@@ sti@@ che of what we think a stadium ought to be .
It means that robots are going to build our buildings , because we &apos;re finally ready for the forms that they &apos;re going to produce .
And it means that buildings will twist to the wh@@ im@@ s of nature instead of the other way around .
It means that a parking garage in Miami Beach , Florida , can also be a place for sports and for yog@@ a and you can even get married there late at night .
It means that no building is too small for innovation , like this little rein@@ deer pa@@ vili@@ on that &apos;s as mus@@ c@@ ly and sin@@ e@@ w@@ y as the animals it &apos;s designed to observe .
And it means that a building doesn &apos;t have to be beautiful to be lo@@ vable , like this ugly little building in Spain , where the architects dug a hole , packed it with ha@@ y , and then poured concrete around it , and when the concrete dri@@ ed , they invited someone to come and clean that ha@@ y out so that all that &apos;s left when it &apos;s done is this hi@@ de@@ ous little room that &apos;s filled with the im@@ prints and scrat@@ ches of how that place was made , and that becomes the most su@@ bli@@ me place to watch a Spanish sun@@ set .
Because it doesn &apos;t matter if a cow builds our buildings or a robot builds our buildings .
It doesn &apos;t matter how we build , it matters what we build .
Archit@@ ects already know how to make buildings that are green@@ er and smarter and friend@@ lier .
We &apos;ve just been waiting for all of you to want them .
And finally , we &apos;re not on opposite sides anymore .
F@@ ind an architect , hire an architect , work with us to design better buildings , better cities , and a better world , because the stakes are high .
Buil@@ dings don &apos;t just reflect our society , they shape our society down to the smallest spaces : the local libraries , the homes where we raise our children , and the walk that they take from the bedroom to the bathroom .
Thank you .
This is my ni@@ ece , Stell@@ a .
She &apos;s just turned one and started to walk .
And she &apos;s walking in that really cool way that one-@@ year-olds do , a kind of te@@ eter@@ ing , my@@ -@@ body &apos;@@ s-@@ mov@@ ing@@ - to@@ o-@@ fast-@@ for-@@ my@@ -@@ legs kind of way .
It is absolutely gorgeous .
And one of her favorite things to do at the moment is to stare at herself in the mirror .
She absolutely loves her reflection .
She gig@@ gles and sque@@ als , and gives herself these big , wet kis@@ ses .
When is it suddenly not okay to love the way that we look ?
Because apparently we don &apos;t .
Ten thousand people every month goog@@ le , &quot; Am I ugly ? &quot;
This is Fa@@ ye . Fa@@ ye is 13 and she lives in Den@@ ver .
And like any teenager , she just wants to be liked and to fit in .
And she &apos;s slightly dre@@ ading it , and she &apos;s a bit confused because despite her mom telling her all the time that she &apos;s beautiful , every day at school , someone tells her that she &apos;s ugly .
Because of the difference between what her mom tells her and what her friends at school , or her peers at school are telling her , she doesn &apos;t know who to believe .
Some of them are so nasty , they don &apos;t bear thinking about .
This is an average , health@@ y-@@ looking teenage girl receiving this feedback at one of the most emotionally vulnerable times in her life .
Well , today &apos;s teenagers are rarely alone .
They &apos;re under pressure to be online and available at all times , talking , messaging , li@@ king , comm@@ enting , sharing , po@@ sting — it never ends .
Never before have we been so connected , so continuously , so inst@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously , so young .
And as one mom told me , it &apos;s like there &apos;s a party in their bedroom every night .
There &apos;s simply no privacy .
And the social pressures that go along with that are rel@@ ent@@ less .
This al@@ wa@@ y@@ s-@@ on environment is training our kids to value themselves based on the number of likes they get and the types of comments that they receive .
There &apos;s no separation between online and offline life .
What &apos;s real or what isn &apos;t is really hard to tell the difference between .
And where are they looking to for inspiration ?
Well , you can see the kinds of images that are covering the new@@ s@@ feeds of girls today .
Si@@ ze zero models still domin@@ ate our cat@@ walks .
Air@@ br@@ ushing is now routine .
And trends like # thin@@ spi@@ ration , # th@@ igh@@ gap , # bi@@ kin@@ i@@ bridge and # pro@@ ana .
For those who don &apos;t know , # pro@@ ana means pro-@@ an@@ or@@ ex@@ ia .
These trends are te@@ amed with the stereotyp@@ ing and flag@@ rant objec@@ tification of women in today &apos;s popular culture .
It is not hard to see what girls are ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king themselves against .
But boys are not immune to this either .
A@@ spir@@ ing to the ch@@ is@@ eled jaw lines and ri@@ pped six packs of super@@ her@@ o-@@ like sports stars and play@@ boy music artists .
But , what &apos;s the problem with all of this ?
Well , surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy , well balanced individuals .
But in an ima@@ ge-@@ obsessed culture , we are training our kids to spend more time and mental effort on their appearance at the expense of all of the other aspects of their identities .
So , things like their relationships , the development of their physical abilities , and their studies and so on begin to suffer .
Six out of 10 girls are now choosing not to do something because they don &apos;t think they look good enough .
These are not trivial activities .
These are fundamental activities to their development as humans and as contribut@@ ors to society and to the workforce .
Thir@@ ty-@@ one percent , nearly one in three teenagers , are with@@ drawing from classroom debate . They &apos;re failing to engage in classroom debate because they don &apos;t want to draw attention to the way that they look .
One in five are not showing up to class at all on days when they don &apos;t feel good about it .
And when it comes to exams , if you don &apos;t think you look good enough , specifically if you don &apos;t think you are thin enough , you will score a lower grade point average than your peers who are not concerned with this .
And this is consistent across Finland , the U.S.
and China , and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh .
So to be super clear , we &apos;re talking about the way you think you look , not how you actually look .
L@@ ow body confidence is under@@ mining academic achievement .
But it &apos;s also damag@@ ing health .
Teen@@ agers with low body confidence do less physical activity , eat less fruits and vegetables , par@@ take in more un@@ healthy weight control practices that can lead to eating disorders .
And we don &apos;t grow out of it .
Women who think they &apos;re over@@ weight — again , regardless of whether they are or are not — have higher rates of ab@@ sent@@ e@@ ei@@ sm .
S@@ event@@ een percent of women would not show up to a job interview on a day when they weren &apos;t feeling confident about the way that they look .
Have a think about what this is doing to our economy .
If we could overcome this , what that opportunity looks like .
Un@@ locking this potential is in the interest of every single one of us .
But how do we do that ?
Well , talking , on its own , only gets you so far .
It &apos;s not enough by itself .
If you actually want to make a difference , you have to do something .
And we &apos;ve learned there are three key ways : The first is we have to educate for body confidence .
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome ima@@ ge-@@ related pressures and build their self-esteem .
Now , the good news is that there are many programs out there available to do this .
The bad news is that most of them don &apos;t work .
I was shocked to learn that many well-@@ meaning programs are in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently actually making the situation worse .
So we need to make damn sure that the programs that our kids are receiving are not only having a positive impact , but having a lasting impact as well .
And the research shows that the best programs address six key areas : The first is the influence of family , friends and relationships .
The second is media and celebrity culture , then how to handle te@@ asing and bul@@ lying , the way we compete and compare with one another based on looks , talking about appearance — some people call this &quot; body talk &quot; or &quot; fat talk &quot; — and finally , the foundations of respec@@ ting and looking after yourself .
Ch@@ allen@@ ging the status quo of how women are seen and talked about in our own circles .
It is not okay that we judge the contribution of our politicians by their hair@@ cuts or the size of their bre@@ asts , or to in@@ fer that the determination or the success of an Olymp@@ ian is down to her not being a loo@@ ker .
We need to start jud@@ ging people by what they do , not what they look like .
We can all start by taking responsibility for the types of pictures and comments that we post on our own social networks .
We can compli@@ ment people based on their effort and their actions and not on their appearance .
And let me ask you , when was the last time that you kis@@ sed a mirror ?
Ul@@ timately , we need to work together as communities , as governments and as businesses to really change this culture of ours so that our kids grow up valu@@ ing their whole selves , valu@@ ing individu@@ ality , diversity , incl@@ usion .
We need to put the people that are making a real difference on our pe@@ dest@@ als , making a difference in the real world .
Gi@@ ving them the air@@ time , because only then will we create a different world .
A world where our kids are free to become the best versions of themselves , where the way they think they look never holds them back from being who they are or achieving what they want in life .
Think about what this might mean for someone in your life .
Your friend ? It could just be the woman a couple of seats away from you today .
What would it mean for her if she were fre@@ ed from that voice of her inner critic , n@@ ag@@ ging her to have longer legs , thin@@ ner th@@ igh@@ s , smaller stomach , shorter feet ?
What could it mean for her if we over@@ came this and un@@ locked her potential in that way ?
Right now , our culture &apos;s obsession with image is holding us all back .
But let &apos;s show our kids the truth .
Let &apos;s show them that the way you look is just one part of your identity and that the truth is we love them for who they are and what they do and how they make us feel .
Let &apos;s build self-esteem into our school curricul@@ ums .
Let &apos;s each and every one of us change the way we talk and compare ourselves to other people .
And let &apos;s work together as communities , from grassroots to governments , so that the happy little one-@@ year-olds of today become the confident chan@@ ge@@ makers of tomorrow .
Let &apos;s do this .
On November 5@@ th , 1990 , a man named El@@ -@@ Sa@@ y@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air walked into a hotel in Manhattan and ass@@ ass@@ inated Rabbi Mei@@ r K@@ ah@@ ane , the leader of the Jewish Defense League .
N@@ os@@ air was initially found not guilty of the murder , but while serving time on less@@ er charges , he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City land@@ marks , including tun@@ nels , sy@@ nago@@ gu@@ es and the United Nations headquarters .
Thank@@ fully , those plans were fo@@ iled by an FBI inform@@ ant .
S@@ adly , the 1993 bom@@ bing of the World Trade Center was not .
I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania in 1983 to him , an Egyptian engineer , and a loving American mother and grade school teacher , who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me .
It wasn &apos;t until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change .
My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people , including the majority of Muslims , get to see .
However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small percentage of people who hold so fer@@ v@@ ently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
We arrived at Cal@@ ver@@ ton Sho@@ oting R@@ ange , which unbe@@ know@@ nst to our group was being watched by the FBI .
That day , the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target burst into fl@@ ames .
They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny .
They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explos@@ ives into the sub-@@ level parking lot of the World Trade Center &apos;s North Tower , causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others .
These were the men I looked up to .
These were the men I called amm@@ u , which means uncle .
By the time I turned 19 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that instability during my childhood didn &apos;t really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone , it was time to pack up and move to the next town .
Being the perpet@@ ual new face in class , I was frequently the target of bul@@ lies .
So for the most part , I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games .
For those reasons , my social skills were l@@ acking , to say the least , and growing up in a big@@ oted household , I wasn &apos;t prepared for the real world .
I &apos;d been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements , like a person &apos;s race or religion .
So what opened my eyes ?
One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections .
Through a college pre@@ p program , I was able to take part in the National Y@@ outh Con@@ vention in Philadelphia .
My particular group &apos;s focus was on youth violence , and having been the victim of bul@@ lying for most of my life , this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate .
The members of our group came from many different walks of life .
One day toward the end of the convention , I found out that one of the kids I had befri@@ ended was Jewish .
Now , it had taken several days for this detail to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural anim@@ osity between the two of us .
There , I was exposed to people from all sorts of fai@@ ths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
Because of that feeling , I was able to contrast the stereotypes I &apos;d been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be gay , but I &apos;m well acqu@@ a@@ in@@ ted with being jud@@ ged for something that &apos;s beyond my control .
Then there was &quot; The Da@@ ily Show . &quot;
Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place , and the fact that a Jewish com@@ edian had done more to posi@@ tively influence my worldview than my own extrem@@ ist father is not lost on me .
One day , I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change , and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live .
She looked at me with the we@@ ary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dog@@ mati@@ sm to last a lifetime , and said , &quot; I &apos;m tired of hat@@ ing people . &quot;
In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
Z@@ ak E@@ bra@@ him is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life .
So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
Well , that &apos;s simple .
Instead , I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the big@@ ot@@ ry .
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
For the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess acts and con@@ dem@@ n my father &apos;s actions .
And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inherent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
I am not my father .
Right now you have a movie playing inside your head .
It &apos;s an amazing multi-@@ track movie .
It has 3D vision and surround sound for what you &apos;re seeing and hearing right now , but that &apos;s just the start of it .
Your movie has smell and taste and touch .
It has a sense of your body , pain , hunger , orgas@@ ms .
It has emotions , anger and happiness .
It has memories , like scenes from your childhood playing before you .
And it has this constant vo@@ ice@@ over narrative in your stream of conscious thinking .
At the heart of this movie is you experiencing all this directly .
This movie is your stream of consciousness , the subject of experience of the mind and the world .
Con@@ sci@@ ousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence .
Each of us is conscious .
We all have our own inner movie , you and you and you .
There &apos;s nothing we know about more directly .
At least , I know about my consciousness directly .
I can &apos;t be certain that you guys are conscious .
Con@@ sci@@ ousness also is what makes life worth living .
If we weren &apos;t conscious , nothing in our lives would have meaning or value .
But at the same time , it &apos;s the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe .
Why aren &apos;t we just robots who process all this input , produce all that output , without experiencing the inner movie at all ?
Right now , nobody knows the answers to those questions .
I &apos;m going to suggest that to integrate consciousness into science , some radical ideas may be needed .
Some people say a science of consciousness is impossible .
Science , by its nature , is objective .
Con@@ sci@@ ousness , by its nature , is subjective .
So there can never be a science of consciousness .
For much of the 20th century , that view held s@@ way .
Psych@@ ologists studied behavior objec@@ tively , neuroscientists studied the brain objec@@ tively , and nobody even mentioned consciousness .
Even 30 years ago , when TED got started , there was very little scientific work on consciousness .
Now , about 20 years ago , all that began to change .
Neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts like Francis Cri@@ ck and physicists like Roger Pen@@ rose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness .
And since then , there &apos;s been a real explosion , a flo@@ wer@@ ing of scientific work on consciousness .
And this work has been wonderful . It &apos;s been great .
But it also has some fundamental limitations so far .
We saw some of this kind of work from Nancy Kan@@ wis@@ her and the wonderful work she presented just a few minutes ago .
Now we understand much better , for example , the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces or of feeling pain or of feeling happy .
But this is still a science of cor@@ relations .
It &apos;s not a science of explanations .
We know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience , but we don &apos;t know why they do .
I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuroscience is answering some of the questions we want answered about consciousness , the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they cor@@ relate with .
But in a certain sense , those are the easy problems .
No knock on the neuroscientists .
There are no truly easy problems with consciousness .
But it doesn &apos;t address the real mystery at the core of this subject : why is it that all that physical processing in a brain should be accompanied by consciousness at all ?
Why is there this inner subjective movie ?
Right now , we don &apos;t really have a be@@ ad on that .
And you might say , let &apos;s just give neuroscience a few years .
It &apos;ll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon like traffic j@@ ams , like hurri@@ can@@ es , like life , and we &apos;ll figure it out .
The classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior , how a traffic jam beha@@ ves , how a hurri@@ cane functions , how a living organism re@@ produces and adap@@ ts and metaboli@@ zes , all questions about objective functioning .
You could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as emergent phenomena : how we walk , how we talk , how we play chess , all these questions about behavior .
But when it comes to consciousness , questions about behavior are among the easy problems .
When it comes to the hard problem , that &apos;s the question of why is it that all this behavior is accompanied by subjective experience ?
And here , the standard paradigm of emergence , even the standard paradig@@ ms of neuroscience , don &apos;t really , so far , have that much to say .
Now , I &apos;m a scientific materi@@ alist at heart .
I want a scientific theory of consciousness that works , and for a long time , I ban@@ ged my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in purely physical terms that would work .
But I eventually came to the conclusion that that just didn &apos;t work for systematic reasons .
So I think we &apos;re at a kind of imp@@ asse here .
We &apos;ve got this wonderful , great chain of explanation , we &apos;re used to it , where physics explains chemistry , chemistry explains biology , biology explains parts of psychology .
But consciousness doesn &apos;t seem to fit into this picture .
On the one hand , it &apos;s a dat@@ um that we &apos;re conscious .
On the other hand , we don &apos;t know how to accom@@ mo@@ date it into our scientific view of the world .
So I think consciousness right now is a kind of an@@ om@@ al@@ y , one that we need to integrate into our view of the world , but we don &apos;t yet see how .
F@@ ac@@ ed with an an@@ om@@ al@@ y like this , radical ideas may be needed , and I think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to gri@@ ps with consciousness scientifically .
Now , there are a few candidates for what those crazy ideas might be .
My friend Dan Den@@ nett , who &apos;s here today , has one .
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness .
The whole idea of the inner subjective movie involves a kind of illusion or confusion .
Actually , all we &apos;ve got to do is explain the objective functions , the behaviors of the brain , and then we &apos;ve explained everything that needs to be explained .
Well I say , more power to him .
That &apos;s the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if you want to have a purely reduc@@ tionist bra@@ in-@@ based theory of consciousness .
At the same time , for me and for many other people , that view is a bit too close to simply den@@ ying the dat@@ um of consciousness to be satis@@ factory .
So I go in a different direction .
In the time remaining , I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise .
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
Physi@@ cists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks : space and time and mass .
They post@@ ulate fundamental laws gover@@ ning them , like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics .
These fundamental properties and laws aren &apos;t explained in terms of anything more basic .
Rather , they &apos;re taken as primitive , and you build up the world from there .
Now sometimes , the list of fundament@@ als expands .
In the 19th century , Ma@@ x@@ well figured out that you can &apos;t explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundament@@ als — space , time , mass , Newton &apos;s laws — so he post@@ ulated fundamental laws of electro@@ magne@@ tism and post@@ ulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern .
I think that &apos;s the situation we &apos;re in with consciousness .
If you can &apos;t explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundament@@ als — space , time , mass , charge — then as a matter of logic , you need to expand the list .
The natural thing to do is to post@@ ulate consciousness itself as something fundamental , a fundamental building block of nature .
This doesn &apos;t mean you suddenly can &apos;t do science with it .
This opens up the way for you to do science with it .
What we then need is to study the fundamental laws gover@@ ning consciousness , the laws that connect consciousness to other fundament@@ als : space , time , mass , physical processes .
Physi@@ cists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t-@@ shirt .
Well I think something like that is the situation we &apos;re in with consciousness .
We want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t-@@ shirt .
We don &apos;t know what those laws are yet , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re after .
The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be universal .
Every system might have some degree of consciousness .
This view is sometimes called pan@@ psych@@ ism : pan for all , p@@ sy@@ ch for mind , every system is conscious , not just humans , dogs , mice , flies , but even Rob K@@ night &apos;s microbes , elementary particles .
Even a phot@@ on has some degree of consciousness .
The idea is not that phot@@ ons are intelligent or thinking .
It &apos;s not that a phot@@ on is w@@ ra@@ cked with angst because it &apos;s thinking , &quot; A@@ w@@ w , I &apos;m always buz@@ zing around near the speed of light .
I never get to slow down and smell the ros@@ es . &quot;
No , not like that .
But the thought is maybe phot@@ ons might have some element of raw , subjective feeling , some primitive pre@@ cursor to consciousness .
This may sound a bit k@@ oo@@ ky to you .
I mean , why would anyone think such a crazy thing ?
Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental .
If it &apos;s fundamental , like space and time and mass , it &apos;s natural to suppose that it might be universal too , the way they are .
It &apos;s also worth not@@ ing that although the idea seems counterintuitive to us , it &apos;s much less counterintuitive to people from different cultures , where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature .
A deeper motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness to physical processing is to link consciousness to information .
Wher@@ ever there &apos;s information processing , there &apos;s consciousness .
Com@@ plex information processing , like in a human , complex consciousness .
Simple information processing , simple consciousness .
A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscienti@@ st , Gi@@ uli@@ o Ton@@ on@@ i , has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigor@@ ously with a mathematical theory .
He has a mathematical measure of information integration which he calls ph@@ i , measuring the amount of information integrated in a system .
And he supp@@ oses that ph@@ i goes along with consciousness .
So in a human brain , incredibly large amount of information integration , high degree of ph@@ i , a whole lot of consciousness .
In a mouse , medium degree of information integration , still pretty significant , pretty serious amount of consciousness .
But as you go down to worms , microbes , particles , the amount of ph@@ i falls off .
The amount of information integration falls off , but it &apos;s still non-@@ zero .
On Ton@@ on@@ i &apos;s theory , there &apos;s still going to be a non-@@ zero degree of consciousness .
In effect , he &apos;s propos@@ ing a fundamental law of consciousness : high ph@@ i , high consciousness .
Now , I don &apos;t know if this theory is right , but it &apos;s actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness , and it &apos;s been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data , and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t-@@ shirt .
Another final motivation is that pan@@ psych@@ ism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world .
Physi@@ cists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curi@@ ously abstract .
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations , but it doesn &apos;t tell us about the reality that under@@ lies it .
As Stephen Hawking puts it , what puts the fire into the equations ?
Well , on the pan@@ psych@@ ist view , you can leave the equations of physics as they are , but you can take them to be describing the flu@@ x of consciousness .
That &apos;s what physics really is ultimately doing , describing the flu@@ x of consciousness .
On this view , it &apos;s consciousness that puts the fire into the equations .
On that view , consciousness doesn &apos;t dan@@ g@@ le outside the physical world as some kind of extra .
It &apos;s there right at its heart .
This view , I think , the pan@@ psych@@ ist view , has the potential to trans@@ figure our relationship to nature , and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical consequences .
Some of these may be counterintuitive .
I used to think I shouldn &apos;t eat anything which is conscious , so therefore I should be veget@@ arian .
Now , if you &apos;re a pan@@ psych@@ ist and you take that view , you &apos;re going to go very hungry .
So I think when you think about it , this tends to trans@@ figure your views , whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral consider@@ ations , not so much the fact of consciousness , but the degree and the complexity of consciousness .
It &apos;s also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems , like computers .
What about the artif@@ ici@@ ally intelligent system in the movie &quot; Her , &quot; Sam@@ an@@ tha ?
Is she conscious ?
Well , if you take the informa@@ tional , pan@@ psych@@ ist view , she certainly has complicated information processing and integration , so the answer is very likely yes , she is conscious .
If that &apos;s right , it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off .
Finally , you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups , the planet .
Does Canada have its own consciousness ?
Or at a more local level , does an integrated group like the audience at a TED conference , are we right now having a collective TED consciousness , an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts ?
I don &apos;t know the answer to that question , but I think it &apos;s at least one worth taking seriously .
Okay , so this pan@@ psych@@ ist vision , it is a radical one , and I don &apos;t know that it &apos;s correct .
I &apos;m actually more confident about the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental , than about the second one , that it &apos;s universal .
I mean , the view raises any number of questions , has any number of challenges , like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love .
If we can answer those questions , then I think we &apos;re going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness .
If not , well , this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy .
We can &apos;t expect to solve it overnight .
But I do think we &apos;re going to figure it out eventually .
Under@@ standing consciousness is a real key , I think , both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves .
It may just take the right crazy idea .
Thank you .
I grew up in a very small country town in Victoria .
I had a very normal , low-@@ key kind of up@@ bringing .
I went to school , I hung out with my friends , I fought with my younger sisters .
It was all very normal .
And when I was 15 , a member of my local community approached my parents and wanted to nom@@ inate me for a community achievement award .
And my parents said , &quot; Hm , that &apos;s really nice , but there &apos;s kind of one gl@@ aring problem with that .
She hasn &apos;t actually achieved anything . &quot; And they were right , you know .
I went to school , I got good marks , I had a very low-@@ key after school job in my mum &apos;s hair@@ d@@ ressing sal@@ on , and I spent a lot of time watching &quot; Buff@@ y the V@@ amp@@ ire S@@ layer &quot; and &quot; Daw@@ son &apos;s Cre@@ ek . &quot;
Yeah , I know . What a contradiction .
But they were right , you know .
Y@@ ears later , I was on my second teaching round in a Mel@@ bour@@ ne high school , and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class when this boy put up his hand and said , &quot; Hey miss , when are you going to start doing your speech ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; What speech ? &quot;
You know , I &apos;d been talking them about de@@ fa@@ mation law for a good 20 minutes .
And he said , &quot; You know , like , your motiv@@ ational speaking .
You know , when people in wheel@@ chairs come to school , they usually say , like , inspi@@ rational stuff ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s usually in the big hall . &quot;
And that &apos;s when it da@@ w@@ ned on me : This kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration .
We are not , to this kid -- and it &apos;s not his fault , I mean , that &apos;s true for many of us .
For lots of us , disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our man@@ ic@@ uri@@ sts .
We &apos;re not real people . We are there to inspire .
And in fact , I am sitting on this stage looking like I do in this wheelchair , and you are probably kind of expecting me to inspire you . Right ? Yeah .
Well , ladies and gentlemen , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to disap@@ point you dramatically .
I am not here to inspire you .
I am here to tell you that we have been lied to about disability .
It &apos;s not a bad thing , and it doesn &apos;t make you excep@@ tional .
And in the past few years , we &apos;ve been able to propag@@ ate this lie even further via social media .
You may have seen images like this one : &quot; The only disability in life is a bad attitude . &quot;
Or this one : &quot; Your excuse is inv@@ al@@ id . &quot; Indeed .
Or this one : &quot; Before you quit , try ! &quot;
These are just a couple of examples , but there are a lot of these images out there .
You know , you might have seen the one , the little girl with no hands drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth .
You might have seen a child running on carbon fiber prosthetic legs .
And these images , there are lots of them out there , they are what we call inspiration por@@ n .
And I use the term por@@ n deliberately , because they objec@@ ti@@ fy one group of people for the benefit of another group of people .
So in this case , we &apos;re objec@@ ti@@ fying disabled people for the benefit of non@@ disabled people .
The purpose of these images is to inspire you , to motivate you , so that we can look at them and think , &quot; Well , however bad my life is , it could be worse .
I could be that person . &quot;
But what if you are that person ?
I &apos;ve lost count of the number of times that I &apos;ve been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think I &apos;m brave or inspi@@ rational , and this was long before my work had any kind of public profile .
They were just kind of con@@ grat@@ ulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember my own name . And it is objec@@ ti@@ fying .
These images , those images objec@@ ti@@ fy disabled people for the benefit of non@@ disabled people .
They are there so that you can look at them and think that things aren &apos;t so bad for you , to put your worries into perspective .
And life as a disabled person is actually somewhat difficult .
We do overcome some things .
But the things that we &apos;re over@@ coming are not the things that you think they are .
They are not things to do with our bodies .
I use the term &quot; disabled people &quot; quite deliberately , because I subscri@@ be to what &apos;s called the social model of disability , which tells us that we are more disabled by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our diagn@@ oses .
So I have lived in this body a long time .
I &apos;m quite f@@ ond of it .
It does the things that I need it to do , and I &apos;ve learned to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have , and that &apos;s the thing about those kids in those pictures as well .
They &apos;re not doing anything out of the ordinary .
They are just using their bodies to the best of their capacity .
So is it really fair to objec@@ ti@@ fy them in the way that we do , to share those images ?
People , when they say , &quot; You &apos;re an inspiration , &quot; they mean it as a compli@@ ment .
And I know why it happens .
It &apos;s because of the lie , it &apos;s because we &apos;ve been sold this lie that disability makes you excep@@ tional .
You know , I &apos;m up here bag@@ ging out inspiration , and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Je@@ ez , Stell@@ a , aren &apos;t you inspired sometimes by some things ? &quot;
And the thing is , I am .
I learn from other disabled people all the time .
I &apos;m learning not that I am lu@@ ck@@ ier than them , though .
I am learning that it &apos;s a genius idea to use a pair of bar@@ bec@@ ue ton@@ gs to pick up things that you dropped . I &apos;m learning that ni@@ f@@ ty trick where you can charge your mobile phone battery from your chair battery .
Geni@@ us .
We are learning from each others &apos; strength and en@@ dur@@ ance , not against our bodies and our diagn@@ oses , but against a world that excep@@ tion@@ ali@@ zes and objec@@ ti@@ fies us .
I really think that this lie that we &apos;ve been sold about disability is the greatest injustice .
It makes life hard for us .
And that quote , &quot; The only disability in life is a bad attitude , &quot; the reason that that &apos;s bull@@ shit is because it &apos;s just not true , because of the social model of disability .
No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ra@@ mp .
It &apos;s just not going to happen .
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception , but the norm .
I want to live in a world where a 15@@ -year-old girl sitting in her bedroom watching &quot; Buff@@ y the V@@ amp@@ ire S@@ layer &quot; isn &apos;t referred to as achieving anything because she &apos;s doing it sitting down .
I want to live in a world where we don &apos;t have such low expectations of disabled people that we are con@@ grat@@ ulated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning .
I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement for disabled people , and I want to live in a world where a kid in year 11 in a Mel@@ bour@@ ne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user .
Dis@@ ability doesn &apos;t make you excep@@ tional , but questioning what you think you know about it does .
Thank you .
What do aug@@ mented reality and professional football have to do with empathy ?
And what is the air speed velocity of an un@@ laden swal@@ low ?
Now unfortunately , I &apos;m only going to answer one of those questions today , so please , try and contain your disap@@ pointment .
When most people think about aug@@ mented reality , they think about &quot; Min@@ ority Report &quot; and Tom Cru@@ ise wa@@ ving his hands in the air , but aug@@ mented reality is not science fiction .
Au@@ g@@ mented reality is something that will happen in our lifetime , and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen , and people need to be aware of that , because aug@@ mented reality will change our lives just as much as the Internet and the cell phone .
Now how do we get to aug@@ mented reality ?
Step one is the step I &apos;m wearing right now , Google Glass .
I &apos;m sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass .
What you may not be familiar with is that Google Glass is a device that will allow you to see what I see .
It will allow you to experience what it is like to be a professional athlete on the field .
Right now , the only way you can be on the field is for me to try and describe it to you .
I have to use words .
I have to create a framework that you then fill in with your imagination .
With Google Glass , we can put that underneath a helmet , and we can get a sense of what it &apos;s like to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour , your blood po@@ unding in your ears .
You can get a sense of what it &apos;s like to have a 25@@ 0-@@ pound man sprin@@ ting at you trying to de@@ capit@@ ate you with every ounce of his being .
And I &apos;ve been on the receiving end of that , and it doesn &apos;t feel very good .
So let &apos;s pull up some video .
Go .
U@@ gh , getting tac@@ kl@@ ed sucks .
Hold on , let &apos;s get a little closer .
All right , ready ?
Go !
Now , you may have noticed there are some people missing there : the rest of the team .
We have some video of that cour@@ tes@@ y of the University of Washington .
Quar@@ ter@@ back : Hey , M@@ ice 54 ! M@@ ice 54 !
Blue 8 ! Blue 8 ! Go !
Oh !
Fans want that experience .
Fans want to be on that field .
They want to be their favorite players , and they &apos;ve already talked to me on YouTube , they &apos;ve talked to me on Twitter , saying , &quot; Hey , can you get this on a quar@@ ter@@ back ?
Well , once we have that experience with Go@@ P@@ ro and Google Glass , how do we make it more immer@@ sive ?
How do we take that next step ?
The O@@ cul@@ us Rift has been described as one of the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created , and that is not empty h@@ ype .
I &apos;m going to show you why that is not empty h@@ ype with this video .
Oh ! Oh !
No ! No ! No ! I don &apos;t want to play anymore ! No !
Oh my God ! A@@ aa@@ ah !
So that is the experience of a man on a ro@@ ller co@@ aster in fear of his life .
What do you think his experience is going to be when he is going down the side of a mountain at over 70 miles an hour as an Olympic down@@ hill sk@@ ier ?
I think adult di@@ aper sales may surge .
But this is not yet aug@@ mented reality .
This is only virtual reality , V@@ .@@ R.
How do we get to aug@@ mented reality , A@@ .@@ R. ?
We get to aug@@ mented reality when co@@ aches and managers and owners look at this information streaming in that people want to see , and they say , &quot; How do we use this to make our teams better ?
How do we use this to win games ? &quot;
Because teams always use technology to win games .
They like winning . It makes them money .
So a brief history of technology in the N@@ F@@ L .
In 1965 , the Baltimore Col@@ ts put a wri@@ st@@ band on their quar@@ ter@@ back to allow him to call plays qu@@ icker .
They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year .
Other teams followed suit .
More people watched the game because it was more exciting .
It was faster .
In 1994 , the N@@ F@@ L put helmet radi@@ os into the hel@@ m@@ ets of the quar@@ ter@@ backs , and later the defense .
More people watched games because it was faster .
It was more enter@@ taining .
In 20@@ 23 , imagine you &apos;re a player walking back to the hu@@ ddle , and you have your next play dis@@ played right in front of your face on your clear plastic vis@@ or that you already wear right now .
No more having to worry about for@@ getting plays .
No more worrying about having to mem@@ orize your play@@ book .
You just go out and react .
And co@@ aches really want this , because missed assign@@ ments lose you games , and co@@ aches hate losing games .
L@@ osing games gets you fired as a coach .
They don &apos;t want that .
But aug@@ mented reality is not just an enhan@@ ced play@@ book .
Au@@ g@@ mented reality is also a way to take all that data and use it in real time to enhance how you play the game .
What would that be like ?
Well , a very simple set@@ up would be a camera on each corner of the stadium looking down , giving you a bird &apos;@@ s-@@ eye view of all the people down there .
You also have information from helmet sensors and acceler@@ ometers , technology that &apos;s being worked on right now .
You take all that information , and you stream it to your players .
The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use .
The bad ones have information over@@ load .
That determines good teams from bad .
And now , your I.@@ T. department is just as important as your sc@@ outing department , and dat@@ a-@@ mining is not for ner@@ ds anymore .
It &apos;s also for jo@@ cks . Who knew ?
What would that look like on the field ?
Well , imagine you &apos;re the quar@@ ter@@ back .
You take the snap and you drop back .
You &apos;re scanning down@@ field for an open receiver .
All of a sudden , a bright flash on the left side of your vis@@ or lets you know , blind side lin@@ eb@@ acker is bli@@ tz@@ ing in .
Nor@@ m@@ ally , you wouldn &apos;t be able to see him , but the aug@@ mented reality system lets you know .
You step up into the pocket .
Another flash al@@ er@@ ts you to an open receiver .
You throw the ball , but you &apos;re hit right as you throw .
The ball comes off track .
You don &apos;t know where it &apos;s going to land .
However , on the receiver &apos;s vis@@ or , he sees a patch of grass light up , and he knows to read@@ just .
He goes , cat@@ ches the ball , sprin@@ ts in , tou@@ ch@@ down .
Crow@@ d goes wild , and the fans are with him every step of the way , watching from every perspective .
Now this is something that will create massive excitement in the game .
It will make tons of people watch , because people want this experience .
Fans want to be on the field .
They want to be their favorite player .
Au@@ g@@ mented reality will be a part of sports , because it &apos;s too profitable not to .
But the question I ask you is , is that &apos;s all that we &apos;re content to use aug@@ mented reality for ?
Are we going to use it sol@@ ely for our pan@@ em , our cir@@ cen@@ ses , our entertainment as normal ?
Because I believe that we can use aug@@ mented reality for something more .
I believe we can use aug@@ mented reality as a way to foster more empathy within the human species itself , by literally showing someone what it looks like to walk a mile in another person &apos;s shoes .
We know what this technology is worth to sports le@@ ag@@ ues .
It &apos;s worth revenue , to the tune of billions of dollars a year .
What is this technology worth to a gay Ug@@ and@@ an or Russian trying to show the world what it &apos;s like living under per@@ sec@@ ution ?
What is this technology worth to a Com@@ man@@ der Had@@ field or a Neil de@@ Gr@@ asse Ty@@ son trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quar@@ ter@@ ly reports and Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ?
Ladies and gentlemen , aug@@ mented reality is coming .
The questions we ask , the choices we make , and the challenges we face are , as always , up to us .
Thank you .
I recently retired from the California Highway Pat@@ ro@@ l after 23 years of service .
The majority of those 23 years was spent pat@@ rolling the southern end of Mar@@ in County , which includes the Golden G@@ ate Bridge .
The bridge is an iconic structure , known worldwide for its beautiful views of San Francisco , the Pacific Ocean , and its inspiring architecture .
Unfortunately , it is also a magnet for suicide , being one of the most utili@@ zed sites in the world .
The Golden G@@ ate Bridge opened in 193@@ 7 .
Joseph Str@@ aus@@ s , chief engineer in charge of building the bridge , was quot@@ ed as saying , &quot; The bridge is practically su@@ ic@@ ide@@ -@@ proof .
Su@@ icide from the bridge is neither practical nor prob@@ able . &quot;
But since its opening , over 1,@@ 600 people have leap@@ t to their death from that bridge .
Some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead you to another dimension -- this bridge has been roman@@ tici@@ zed as such — that the fall from that fre@@ es you from all your worries and grief , and the waters below will clean@@ se your soul .
But let me tell you what actually occurs when the bridge is used as a means of suicide .
That impact sh@@ at@@ ters bones , some of which then punc@@ ture vital organs .
Most die on impact .
Those that don &apos;t generally fla@@ il in the water helpl@@ ess@@ ly , and then dro@@ wn .
I don &apos;t think that those who contem@@ plate this method of suicide realize how gr@@ is@@ ly a death that they will face .
This is the cord .
Except for around the two towers , there is 32 inches of steel parall@@ eling the bridge .
This is where most folks stand before taking their lives .
I can tell you from experience that once the person is on that cord , and at their dark@@ est time , it is very difficult to bring them back .
I took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an officer contempl@@ ating her life .
I want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day in getting her back over the rail .
When I first began working on the bridge , we had no formal training .
You struggled to fun@@ nel your way through these calls .
This was not only a dis@@ service to those contempl@@ ating suicide , but to the officers as well .
We &apos;ve come a long , long way since then .
Now , veter@@ an officers and psychologists train new officers .
This is Jason Gar@@ ber .
I met Jason on July 22 of last year when I get received a call of a possible su@@ ici@@ dal subject sitting on the cord near mid@@ span .
I responded , and when I arrived , I observed Jason speaking to a Golden G@@ ate Bridge officer .
Jason was just 32 years old and had flown out here from New Jersey .
After about an hour of speaking with Jason , he asked us if we knew the story of P@@ and@@ ora &apos;s box .
Rec@@ alling your Greek mythology , Zeu@@ s created P@@ and@@ ora , and sent her down to Earth with a box , and told her , &quot; Never , ever open that box . &quot;
Well one day , curiosity got the better of P@@ and@@ ora , and she did open the box .
Out flew pl@@ ag@@ ues , sor@@ rows , and all sorts of ev@@ ils against man .
The only good thing in the box was hope .
Jason then asked us , &quot; What happens when you open the box and hope isn &apos;t there ? &quot;
He paus@@ ed a few moments , lean@@ ed to his right , and was gone .
This kind , intelligent young man from New Jersey had just committed suicide .
I spoke with Jason &apos;s parents that evening , and I suppose that , when I was speaking with them , that I didn &apos;t sound as if I was doing very well , because that very next day , their family r@@ abbi called to check on me .
Jason &apos;s parents had asked him to do so .
The coll@@ at@@ eral damage of suicide affects so many people .
I pose these questions to you : What would you do if your family member , friend or loved one was su@@ ici@@ dal ?
What would you say ?
Would you know what to say ?
In my experience , it &apos;s not just the talking that you do , but the listening .
Listen to understand .
Don &apos;t argue , blame , or tell the person you know how they feel , because you probably don &apos;t .
By just being there , you may just be the turning point that they need .
If you think someone is su@@ ici@@ dal , don &apos;t be afraid to confront them and ask the question .
One way of asking them the question is like this : &quot; Others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life ; have you had these thoughts ? &quot;
Con@@ fron@@ ting the person head-@@ on may just save their life and be the turning point for them .
Some other signs to look for : hop@@ elessness , believing that things are terrible and never going to get better ; helpl@@ ess@@ ness , believing that there is nothing that you can do about it ; recent social with@@ dra@@ wal ; and a loss of interest in life .
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago , and I received an email from a lady that I &apos;d like to read you her letter .
She lost her son on January 19 of this year , and she wrote this me this email just a couple of days ago , and it &apos;s with her permission and bl@@ essing that I read this to you .
&quot; Hi , Kevin . I imagine you &apos;re at the TED Conference .
That must be quite the experience to be there .
I &apos;m thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend .
Just wanted to drop you a note .
H@@ ope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends , etc .
I &apos;m still pretty numb , but noticing more moments of really realizing Mike isn &apos;t coming home .
Mike was driving from Pet@@ al@@ um@@ a to San Francisco to watch the 4@@ 9@@ ers game with his father on January 19 .
He never made it there .
I called Pet@@ al@@ um@@ a police and reported him missing that evening .
The next morning , two officers came to my home and reported that Mike &apos;s car was down at the bridge .
A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge at 1 : 58 p.m. the previous day .
Thanks so much for standing up for those who may be only tempor@@ arily too weak to stand for themselves .
Who hasn &apos;t been low before without suffering from a true mental illness ?
It shouldn &apos;t be so easy to end it .
My pra@@ yers are with you for your fight .
The G@@ GB , Golden G@@ ate Bridge , is supposed to be a passage across our beautiful bay , not a gra@@ v@@ ey@@ ard .
Good luck this week . V@@ ick@@ y . &quot;
I can &apos;t imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the path that her son took that day , and also the courage just to carry on .
I &apos;d like to introduce you to a man I refer to as hope and courage .
On March 11 of 2005 , I responded to a radio call of a possible su@@ ici@@ dal subject on the bridge sidewalk near the north tower .
I ro@@ de my motor@@ cycle down the sidewalk and observed this man , Kevin Ber@@ th@@ ia , standing on the sidewalk .
For the next hour and a half , I listened as Kevin spoke about his depression and hop@@ elessness .
Kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that rail and give life another chance .
When Kevin came back over , I con@@ grat@@ ulated him .
&quot; This is a new beginning , a new life . &quot;
But I asked him , &quot; What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chance ? &quot;
And you know what he told me ?
He said , &quot; You listened .
You let me speak , and you just listened . &quot;
Shor@@ tly after this incident , I received a letter from Kevin &apos;s mother , and I have that letter with me , and I &apos;d like to read it to you .
&quot; De@@ ar Mr. Bri@@ g@@ gs , Nothing will erase the events of March 11 , but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us .
I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help .
He has been diagnosed with a mental illness for which he has been properly medic@@ ated .
I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old , completely un@@ aware of any her@@ edi@@ tary traits , but , thank God , now we know .
Kevin is straight , as he says .
We truly thank God for you .
Sin@@ cer@@ ely inde@@ b@@ ted to you , Nar@@ v@@ ella Ber@@ th@@ ia . &quot;
And on the bottom she writes , &quot; P@@ .S. When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening , you were listed as the patient .
Boy , did I have to stra@@ igh@@ ten that one out . &quot;
Today , Kevin is a loving father and contributing member of society .
He speaks open@@ ly about the events that day and his depression in the hopes that his story will inspire others .
Su@@ icide is not just something I &apos;ve encountered on the job .
It &apos;s personal .
My grandfather committed suicide by pois@@ oning .
That act , although ending his own pain , rob@@ bed me from ever getting to know him .
This is what suicide does .
For most su@@ ici@@ dal folks , or those contempl@@ ating suicide , they wouldn &apos;t think of hur@@ ting another person .
They just want their own pain to end .
Typ@@ ically , this is accomplished in just three ways : sleep , drugs or alcohol , or death .
In my career , I &apos;ve responded to and been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge .
Of those inci@@ dents I &apos;ve been directly involved with , I &apos;ve only lost two , but that &apos;s two too many .
One was Jason .
The other was a man I spoke to for about an hour .
During that time , he sh@@ ook my hand on three occas@@ ions .
On that final hand@@ shake , he looked at me , and he said , &quot; Kevin , I &apos;m sorry , but I have to go . &quot;
And he leap@@ t .
I do want to tell you , though , the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge do not commit suicide .
Ad@@ di@@ tionally , that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived and can talk about it , that one to two percent , most of those folks have said that the second that they let go of that rail , they knew that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live .
I tell people , the bridge not only connects Mar@@ in to San Francisco , but people together also .
That connection , or bridge that we make , is something that each and every one of us should stri@@ ve to do .
Su@@ icide is preventable .
There is help . There is hope .
Thank you very much .
The world makes you something that you &apos;re not , but you know inside what you are , and that question burns in your heart : How will you become that ?
I may be somewhat unique in this , but I am not alone , not alone at all .
So when I became a fashion model , I felt that I &apos;d finally achieved the dream that I &apos;d always wanted since I was a young child .
My outside self finally matched my inner truth , my inner self .
For complicated reasons which I &apos;ll get to later , when I look at this picture , at that time I felt like , Ge@@ ena , you &apos;ve done it , you &apos;ve made it , you have arrived .
But this past October , I realized that I &apos;m only just beginning .
All of us are put in boxes by our family , by our religion , by our society , our moment in history , even our own bodies .
Some people have the courage to break free , not to accept the limitations imposed by the color of their skin or by the beliefs of those that surround them .
Those people are always the threat to the status quo , to what is considered acceptable .
In my case , for the last nine years , some of my neighbors , some of my friends , colleagues , even my agent , did not know about my history .
I remember when I was five years old in the Philipp@@ ines walking around our house , I would always wear this t-@@ shirt on my head .
And my mom asked me , &quot; How come you always wear that t-@@ shirt on your head ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Mom , this is my hair . I &apos;m a girl . &quot;
I knew then how to self-@@ identify .
Gen@@ der has always been considered a fact , imm@@ ut@@ able , but we now know it &apos;s actually more fluid , complex and mysterious .
Because of my success , I never had the courage to share my story , not because I thought what I am is wrong , but because of how the world tre@@ ats those of us who wish to break free .
Every day , I am so grateful because I am a woman .
I have a mom and dad and family who accepted me for who I am .
Many are not so fortunate .
There &apos;s a long tradition in Asian culture that celebr@@ ates the fluid mystery of gender .
There is a Buddhist go@@ dd@@ ess of compassion .
There is a Hindu go@@ dd@@ ess , hij@@ ra go@@ dd@@ ess .
So when I was eight years old , I was at a f@@ ie@@ sta in the Philipp@@ ines celebrating these mysteries .
I was in front of the stage , and I remember , out comes this beautiful woman right in front of me , and I remember that moment something hit me : That is the kind of woman I would like to be .
So when I was 15 years old , still d@@ ressing as a boy , I met this woman named T@@ .@@ L@@ .
She is a trans@@ gender beauty pa@@ ge@@ ant manager .
That night she asked me , &quot; How come you are not joining the beauty pa@@ ge@@ ant ? &quot;
That moment changed my life .
All of a sudden , I was introduced to the world of beauty pa@@ ge@@ ants .
Not a lot of people could say that your first job is a pa@@ ge@@ ant queen for trans@@ gender women , but I &apos;ll take it .
So from 15 to 17 years old , I joined the most pre@@ stig@@ ious pa@@ ge@@ ant to the pa@@ ge@@ ant where it &apos;s at the back of the truck , literally , or sometimes it would be a pa@@ vement next to a rice field , and when it rains -- it rains a lot in the Philipp@@ ines -- the organiz@@ ers would have to move it inside someone &apos;s house .
I also experienced the goodness of strangers , especially when we would travel in remote provin@@ ces in the Philipp@@ ines .
But most importantly , I met some of my best friends in that community .
In 2001 , my mom , who had moved to San Francisco , called me and told me that my green card petition came through , that I could now move to the United States .
I resist@@ ed it .
I told my mom , &quot; Mom , I &apos;m having fun .
I &apos;m here with my friends , I love traveling , being a beauty pa@@ ge@@ ant queen . &quot;
But then two weeks later she called me , she said , &quot; Did you know that if you move to the United States you could change your name and gender marker ? &quot;
That was all I needed to hear .
My mom also told me to put two E &apos;s in the sp@@ elling of my name .
She also came with me when I had my surgery in Thailand at 19 years old .
It &apos;s interesting , in some of the most rural cities in Thailand , they perform some of the most pre@@ stig@@ ious , safe and sophisticated surgery .
At that time in the United States , you needed to have surgery before you could change your name and gender marker .
So in 2001 , I moved to San Francisco , and I remember looking at my California driver &apos;s license with the name Ge@@ ena and gender marker F.
That was a powerful moment .
For some people , their I@@ .D. is their license to drive or even to get a drink , but for me , that was my license to live , to feel dig@@ ni@@ fied .
I felt that I could con@@ quer my dream and move to New York and be a model .
Many are not so fortunate .
I think of this woman named Isl@@ an N@@ ett@@ les .
She &apos;s from New York , she &apos;s a young woman who was coura@@ ge@@ ously living her truth , but hatred ended her life .
For most of my community , this is the reality in which we live .
Our suicide rate is nine times higher than that of the general population .
Every November 20 , we have a global vi@@ gi@@ l for Trans@@ gender Day of Rem@@ em@@ br@@ ance .
I &apos;m here at this stage because it &apos;s a long history of people who fought and stood up for injustice .
This is Mar@@ sha P. Johnson and Sylvia River@@ a .
Today , this very moment , is my real coming out .
I could no longer live my truth for and by myself .
I want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame and terror .
I am here , exposed , so that one day there will never be a need for a November 20 vi@@ gi@@ l .
My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am .
Will you ?
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m wondering what you would say , especially to parents , but in a more broad way , to friends , to family , to anyone who finds themselves encounter@@ ing a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that &apos;s being assigned them , what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them ?
Ge@@ ena R@@ oc@@ er@@ o : Sure . Well , first , really , I &apos;m so blessed .
And sometimes it works , sometimes it doesn &apos;t , so — But it &apos;s just , gender identity is in the core of our being , right ?
I mean , we &apos;re all assigned gender at birth , so what I &apos;m trying to do is to have this conversation that sometimes that gender assignment doesn &apos;t match , and there should be a space that would allow people to self-@@ identify , and that &apos;s a conversation that we should have with parents , with colleagues .
The trans@@ gender movement , it &apos;s at the very beginning , to compare to how the gay movement started .
There &apos;s still a lot of work that needs to be done .
There should be an understanding .
There should be a space of curiosity and asking questions , and I hope all of you guys will be my allies .
Thank you . That was so lovely . Thank you .
In many patri@@ arch@@ al societies and tribal societies , fathers are usually known by their sons , but I &apos;m one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter , and I am proud of it .
Before that , she was my daughter , but now I am her father .
Ladies and gentlemen , if we gl@@ ance to human history , the story of women is the story of injustice , inequality , violence and explo@@ itation .
She is not wel@@ com@@ ed , neither by father nor by mother .
The neighborhood comes and commis@@ er@@ ates with the mother , and nobody con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ates the father .
And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child .
When she gives birth to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sad .
When she gives birth to the second daughter , she is shocked , and in the expectation of a son , when she gives birth to a third daughter , she feels guilty like a criminal .
Not only the mother suff@@ ers , but the daughter , the newly born daughter , when she grows old , she suff@@ ers too .
At the age of five , while she should be going to school , she stays at home and her brothers are ad@@ mitted in a school .
Until the age of 12 , somehow , she has a good life .
She can have fun .
She can play with her friends in the streets , and she can move around in the streets like a butter@@ fly .
But when she enters her te@@ ens , when she becomes 13 years old , she is forbi@@ dden to go out of her home without a male esc@@ ort .
She is confined under the four walls of her home .
She is no more a free individual .
She becomes the so-called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family , and if she trans@@ gres@@ ses the code of that so-called honor , she could even be killed .
And it is also interesting that this so-called code of honor , it does not only affect the life of a girl , it also affects the life of the male members of the family .
I know a family of seven sisters and one brother , and that one brother , he has mig@@ rated to the Gulf countries , to earn a living for his seven sisters and parents , because he thinks that it will be humili@@ ating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some livel@@ ihood .
So this brother , he sacrific@@ es the jo@@ ys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so-called honor .
And there is one more norm of the patri@@ arch@@ al societies that is called obe@@ di@@ ence .
A good girl is supposed to be very quiet , very humble and very sub@@ mis@@ sive .
It is the criteria .
The role model good girl should be very quiet .
She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders , even if she does not like them .
Otherwise , she will be called dis@@ obe@@ dient .
And what happens at the end ?
In the words of a po@@ et@@ ess , she is we@@ d@@ ded , bed@@ ded , and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters .
And this vi@@ cious cycle goes on , goes on .
Ladies and gentlemen , this p@@ light of millions of women could be changed if we think differently , if women and men think differently , if men and women in the tribal and patri@@ arch@@ al societies in the developing countries , if they can break a few norms of family and society , if they can aboli@@ sh the discrimin@@ atory laws of the systems in their states , which go against the basic human rights of the women .
De@@ ar brothers and sisters , when Mal@@ ala was born , and for the first time , believe me , I don &apos;t like new@@ born children , to be honest , but when I went and I looked into her eyes , believe me , I got extremely honored .
And long before she was born , I thought about her name , and I was fascinated with a heroic le@@ gen@@ dary freedom figh@@ ter in Afghanistan .
Her name was Mal@@ al@@ ai of Ma@@ i@@ wand , and I named my daughter after her .
A few days after Mal@@ ala was born , my daughter was born , my cousin came -- and it was a coincidence -- he came to my home and he brought a family tree , a family tree of the You@@ saf@@ z@@ ai family , and when I looked at the family tree , it tra@@ ced back to 300 years of our ancestors .
But when I looked , all were men , and I picked my pen , drew a line from my name , and wrote , &quot; Mal@@ ala . &quot;
And when she grow old , when she was four and a half years old , I ad@@ mitted her in my school .
You will be asking , then , why should I mention about the ad@@ mission of a girl in a school ?
Yes , I must mention it .
It may be taken for granted in Canada , in America , in many developed countries , but in poor countries , in patri@@ arch@@ al societies , in tribal societies , it &apos;s a big event for the life of girl .
En@@ roll@@ ment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name .
Ad@@ mission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potenti@@ als for her future life .
I have five sisters , and none of them could go to school , and you will be aston@@ ished , two weeks before , when I was filling out the Canadian vis@@ a form , and I was filling out the family part of the form , I could not recall the sur@@ names of some of my sisters .
And the reason was that I have never , never seen the names of my sisters written on any document .
What my father could not give to my sisters and to his daughters , I thought I must change it .
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilli@@ ance of my daughter .
I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come .
I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings .
And all these good values , I tried to in@@ cul@@ cate in her personality .
And this was not only she , only Mal@@ ala .
I im@@ par@@ ted all these good values to my school , girl students and boy students as well .
I used education for eman@@ cip@@ ation .
I taught my girls , I taught my girl students , to un@@ learn the lesson of obe@@ di@@ ence .
I taught my boy students to un@@ learn the lesson of so-called p@@ seu@@ do-@@ honor .
De@@ ar brothers and sisters , we were stri@@ ving for more rights for women , and we were struggling to have more , more and more space for the women in society .
But we came across a new phenomenon .
It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women &apos;s rights .
It was called Tali@@ ban@@ ization .
It means a complete neg@@ ation of women &apos;s participation in all political , econom@@ ical and social activities .
Hundreds of schools were lost .
Girls were pro@@ hi@@ b@@ ited from going to school .
Women were forced to wear v@@ eils and they were stopped from going to the markets .
Mus@@ icians were sil@@ enced , girls were flo@@ gged and singers were killed .
Milli@@ ons were suffering , but few spoke , and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog , and you speak for your rights .
It &apos;s really the most scary thing .
At the age of 10 , Mal@@ ala stood , and she stood for the right of education .
She wrote a di@@ ary for the BBC blog , she volunte@@ ered herself for the New York Times docum@@ ent@@ aries , and she spoke from every platform she could .
And her voice was the most powerful voice .
It spread like a c@@ res@@ cen@@ do all around the world .
And that was the reason the Taliban could not toler@@ ate her campaign , and on October 9 2012 , she was shot in the head at point blank range .
It was a do@@ om@@ s@@ day for my family and for me .
The world turned into a big black hole .
While my daughter was on the verge of life and death , I whis@@ per@@ ed into the ears of my wife , &quot; Should I be bl@@ amed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter ? &quot;
And she ab@@ rup@@ tly told me , &quot; Please don &apos;t blame yourself .
You stood for the right cause .
You put your life at stake for the cause of truth , for the cause of peace , and for the cause of education , and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you .
You both were on the right path and God will protect her . &quot;
These few words meant a lot to me , and I didn &apos;t ask this question again .
When Mal@@ ala was in the hospital , and she was going through the severe pa@@ ins and she had had severe head@@ aches because her facial nerve was cut down , I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife .
But my daughter never compla@@ ined .
She used to tell us , &quot; I &apos;m fine with my cro@@ o@@ ked smile and with my num@@ b@@ ness in my face .
I &apos;ll be okay . Please don &apos;t worry . &quot;
She was a sol@@ ace for us , and she con@@ sol@@ ed us .
De@@ ar brothers and sisters , we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women , she is like any 16-@@ year old girl .
She cri@@ es when her homework is incomplete .
She quar@@ rels with her brothers , and I am very happy for that .
People ask me , what special is in my ment@@ or@@ ship which has made Mal@@ ala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and pois@@ ed ?
I tell them , don &apos;t ask me what I did .
Ask me what I did not do .
I did not clip her wings , and that &apos;s all .
Thank you very much .
I had brain surgery 18 years ago , and since that time , brain science has become a personal passion of mine .
I &apos;m actually an engineer .
So that said , there &apos;s a stigma when you have brain surgery .
Are you still smart or not ?
And if not , can you make yourself smart again ?
Im@@ medi@@ ately after my surgery , I had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day , because if I just took nothing , I would die within hours .
There have been several close calls .
But luckily , I &apos;m an experiment@@ alist at heart , so I decided I would experiment to try to find more optimal dos@@ ages because there really isn &apos;t a clear road map on this that &apos;s detailed .
I began to try different mix@@ tures , and I was blown away by how tiny changes in dos@@ ages dramatically changed my sense of self , my sense of who I was , my thinking , my behavior towards people .
One particularly dramatic case : for a couple months I actually tried dos@@ ages and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s , and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed .
I was kind of extreme .
But to me , the surprise was , I wasn &apos;t trying to be arrogant .
I was actually trying , with a little bit of in@@ security , to actually fix a problem in front of me , and it just didn &apos;t come out that way .
But that experience , I think , gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through , and I &apos;ve gotten along with men a lot better since then .
What I was trying to do with tun@@ ing these hormones and neuro@@ transmit@@ ters and so forth was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery , my creative thought , my idea flow .
And I think mostly in images , and so for me that became a key metric -- how to get these mental images that I use as a way of rapid prototyping , if you will , my ideas , trying on different new ideas for size , playing out scenarios .
This kind of thinking isn &apos;t new .
Phili@@ osop@@ hers like Hu@@ me and Des@@ car@@ tes and Hob@@ bes saw things similarly .
They thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing .
There are those today that dis@@ pu@@ te that , and lots of deb@@ ates about how the mind works , but for me it &apos;s simple : M@@ ental images , for most of us , are central in inv@@ enti@@ ve and creative thinking .
So after several years , I tuned myself up and I have lots of great , really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistic@@ ation and the analy@@ tical back@@ bone behind them .
And so now I &apos;m working on , how can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster ?
Can you imagine , if you will , a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her ?
Or a musician to get the music out of his head ?
There are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed .
So let me show you why I think we &apos;re pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuroscience groups .
Both used f@@ MRI technology -- functional magnetic resonance imaging technology -- to image the brain , and here is a brain scan set from Gi@@ or@@ gi@@ o Gan@@ is and his colleagues at Harvard .
And the left-hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image .
The middle column shows the bra@@ ins@@ can of that same individual imagining , seeing that same image .
And the right column was created by sub@@ trac@@ ting the middle column from the left column , showing the difference to be nearly zero .
This was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different images , always with a similar result .
The difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is next to nothing .
Next let me share with you one other experiment , this from Jack Gall@@ ant &apos;s lab at C@@ al Berkeley .
In this experiment , individuals were shown hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while scans were made of their brains to create a large library of their brain reacting to video sequences .
Then a new movie was shown with new images , new people , new animals in it , and a new scan set was recorded .
The computer , using brain scan data alone , de@@ coded that new brain scan to show what it thought the individual was actually seeing .
On the right-hand side , you see the computer &apos;s guess , and on the left-hand side , the presented clip .
This is the j@@ aw@@ -@@ dro@@ pper .
We are so close to being able to do this .
We just need to up the resolution .
And now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image , it creates the same brain scan .
So this was done with the high@@ est@@ -@@ resolution brain scan systems available today , and their resolution has increased really about a thous@@ and@@ fold in the last several years .
Next we need to increase the resolution another thous@@ and@@ fold to get a deeper glimpse .
How do we do that ?
There &apos;s a lot of techniques in this approach .
One way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes .
I &apos;m not for that .
There &apos;s a lot of new imaging techniques being proposed , some even by me , but given the recent success of MRI , first we need to ask the question , is it the end of the road with this technology ?
Con@@ ven@@ tional wisdom says the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets , but at this point bigger magnets only offer incre@@ mental resolution improvements , not the thous@@ and@@ fold we need .
I &apos;m putting forward an idea : instead of bigger magnets , let &apos;s make better magnets .
We can create much more complicated structures with slightly different arran@@ gements , kind of like making Spi@@ ro@@ graph .
So why does that matter ?
A lot of effort in MRI over the years has gone into making really big , really huge magnets , right ?
But yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from in@@ geni@@ ously clever en@@ coding and de@@ coding solutions in the F@@ .@@ M. radio frequency transmit@@ ters and recei@@ vers in the MRI systems .
Let &apos;s also , instead of a uniform magnetic field , put down structured magnetic patterns in addition to the F@@ .@@ M. radio frequencies .
So by combin@@ ing the magne@@ tics patterns with the patterns in the F@@ .@@ M. radio frequencies processing which can massively increase the information that we can extract in a single scan .
And using f@@ MRI , we should be able to measure not just oxy@@ gen@@ ated blood flow , but the hormones and neuro@@ transmit@@ ters I &apos;ve talked about and maybe even the direct neural activity , which is the dream .
We &apos;re going to be able to dump our ideas directly to digital media .
Could you imagine if we could leap@@ frog language and communicate directly with human thought ?
What would we be capable of then ?
And how will we learn to deal with the truths of un@@ fil@@ tered human thought ?
You think the Internet was big .
These are huge questions .
It might be ir@@ resist@@ i@@ ble as a tool to ampli@@ fy our thinking and communication skills .
And indeed , this very same tool may prove to lead to the cure for Alzheimer &apos;s and similar diseases .
We have little option but to open this door .
It &apos;s hard to imagine it taking much longer .
We need to learn how to take this step together .
Thank you .
I think we all have clos@@ ets .
Your closet may be telling someone you love her for the first time , or telling someone that you &apos;re pregnant , or telling someone you have cancer , or any of the other hard conversations we have throughout our lives .
All a closet is is a hard conversation , and although our topics may vary tremendously , the experience of being in and coming out of the closet is universal .
It is scary , and we hate it , and it needs to be done .
Sever@@ al years ago , I was working at the South Side Wal@@ nut C@@ afe , a local din@@ er in town , and during my time there I would go through ph@@ ases of milit@@ ant lesbian intensity : not s@@ having my ar@@ mp@@ its , quot@@ ing An@@ i Di@@ Fran@@ co ly@@ rics as g@@ os@@ pel .
And depending on the bag@@ g@@ iness of my car@@ go shor@@ ts and how recently I had sha@@ ved my head , the question would often be sprung on me , usually by a little kid : &quot; Um , are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot;
And there would be an awkward silence at the table .
I &apos;d cl@@ en@@ ch my jaw a little ti@@ ghter , hold my coffee pot with a little more ven@@ ge@@ ance .
The dad would awk@@ war@@ dly shuff@@ le his newspaper and the mom would shoot a ch@@ illing stare at her kid .
But I would say nothing , and I would see@@ the inside .
So I promised myself , the next time , I would say something .
I would have that hard conversation .
So within a matter of weeks , it happens again .
&quot; Are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot;
I &apos;ve got my Gl@@ oria St@@ einem quotes .
I &apos;ve even got this little bit from &quot; Vagina Mon@@ olog@@ ues &quot; I &apos;m going to do .
So I take a deep breath and I look down and staring back at me is a four@@ -year-old girl in a pink dress , not a challenge to a feminist du@@ el , just a kid with a question : &quot; Are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot;
So I take another deep breath , squ@@ at down to next to her , and say , &quot; Hey , I know it &apos;s kind of confusing .
My hair is short like a boy &apos;s , and I wear boy &apos;s clothes , but I &apos;m a girl , and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress , and sometimes you like to wear your com@@ fy j@@ amm@@ ies ?
Well , I &apos;m more of a com@@ fy j@@ amm@@ ies kind of girl . &quot;
And this kid looks me dead in the eye , without missing a beat , and says , &quot; My favorite pa@@ j@@ amas are purple with fish .
Can I get a pan@@ cake , please ? &quot;
How about that pan@@ cake ? &quot;
It was the easiest hard conversation I have ever had .
And why ? Because Pan@@ cake Girl and I , we were both real with each other .
So like many of us , I &apos;ve lived in a few clos@@ ets in my life , and yeah , most often , my walls happened to be rain@@ bow .
But inside , in the dark , you can &apos;t tell what color the walls are .
You just know what it feels like to live in a closet .
So really , my closet is no different than yours or yours or yours .
Sure , I &apos;ll give you 100 reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours , but here &apos;s the thing : H@@ ard is not relative .
H@@ ard is hard .
Who can tell me that explaining to someone you &apos;ve just declared bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy is harder than telling someone you just che@@ ated on them ?
Who can tell me that his coming out story is harder than telling your five-@@ year-old you &apos;re getting a divorce ?
There is no harder , there is just hard .
We need to stop ran@@ king our hard against everyone else &apos;s hard to make us feel better or worse about our clos@@ ets and just commis@@ er@@ ate on the fact that we all have hard .
At some point in our lives , we all live in clos@@ ets , and they may feel safe , or at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door .
But I am here to tell you , no matter what your walls are made of , a closet is no place for a person to live .
Me , I had a pon@@ y@@ tail , a str@@ ap@@ less dress , and high-@@ he@@ eled shoes .
I was not the milit@@ ant lesbian ready to fight any four@@ -year-old that walked into the cafe .
I was frozen by fear , cur@@ led up in the corner of my pit@@ ch-@@ black closet cl@@ ut@@ ching my gay gr@@ en@@ ade , and moving one muscle is the scar@@ iest thing I have ever done .
My family , my friends , complete strangers -- I had spent my entire life trying to not disap@@ point these people , and now I was turning the world upside down on purpose .
I was burning the pages of the script we had all followed for so long , but if you do not throw that gr@@ en@@ ade , it will kill you .
One of my most memor@@ able gr@@ en@@ ade tos@@ ses was at my sister &apos;s wedding .
And after a little small talk , one of the women sh@@ ou@@ ted out , &quot; I love Nathan L@@ ane ! &quot;
And the battle of gay rel@@ at@@ ability had begun .
&quot; A@@ sh , have you ever been to the Ca@@ str@@ o ? &quot;
&quot; Well , yeah , actually , we have friends in San Francisco . &quot;
&quot; Well , we &apos;ve never been there but we &apos;ve heard it &apos;s fabulous . &quot;
&quot; A@@ sh , do you know my hair@@ d@@ res@@ ser Ant@@ on@@ io ?
He &apos;s really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; A@@ sh , what &apos;s your favorite TV show ?
Our favorite TV show ? Favor@@ ite : Will &amp; amp ; Grace .
And you know who we love ? Jack .
Jack is our favorite . &quot;
And then one woman , st@@ ump@@ ed but wanting so desperately to show her support , to let me know she was on my side , she finally blur@@ ted out , &quot; Well , sometimes my husband we@@ ars pink shirts . &quot;
I could go back to my girlfriend and my ga@@ y-@@ loving table and mo@@ ck their responses , ch@@ ast@@ ise their un@@ world@@ lin@@ ess and their in@@ ability to jump through the politically correct gay ho@@ ops I had brought with me , or I could empath@@ ize with them and realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done , that starting and having that conversation was them coming out of their clos@@ ets .
Sure , it would have been easy to point out where they felt short .
It &apos;s a lot harder to meet them where they are and acknowledge the fact that they were trying .
And what else can you ask someone to do but try ?
If you &apos;re going to be real with someone , you gotta be ready for real in return .
So hard conversations are still not my strong suit .
Ask anybody I have ever dated .
But I &apos;m getting better , and I follow what I like to call the three Pan@@ cake Girl principles .
Now , please view this through ga@@ y-@@ colored lenses , but know what it takes to come out of any closet is essentially the same .
Number one : Be authentic .
Take the arm@@ or off . Be yourself .
That kid in the cafe had no arm@@ or , but I was ready for battle .
If you want someone to be real with you , they need to know that you ble@@ ed too .
Number two : Be direct . Just say it . Ri@@ p the B@@ and-@@ Aid off .
If you know you are gay , just say it .
If you tell your parents you might be gay , they will hold out hope that this will change .
Do not give them that sense of false hope .
You are speaking your truth .
Never apologize for that .
And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way , so sure , apologize for what you &apos;ve done , but never apologize for who you are .
And yeah , some folks may be disappointed , but that is on them , not on you .
Those are their expectations of who you are , not yours .
That is their story , not yours .
The only story that matters is the one that you want to write .
So the next time you find yourself in a pit@@ ch-@@ black closet cl@@ ut@@ ching your gr@@ en@@ ade , know we have all been there before .
And you may feel so very alone , but you are not .
And we know it &apos;s hard but we need you out here , no matter what your walls are made of , because I guarantee you there are others pe@@ ering through the key@@ holes of their clos@@ ets looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open , so be that person and show the world that we are bigger than our clos@@ ets and that a closet is no place for a person to truly live .
Intelli@@ gence -- what is it ?
If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed , one sem@@ inal example has been Ed@@ s@@ ger Di@@ j@@ k@@ str@@ a &apos;s famous quote that &quot; the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a sub@@ marine can swim . &quot;
Now , Ed@@ s@@ ger Di@@ j@@ k@@ str@@ a , when he wrote this , intended it as a criticism of the early pion@@ eers of computer science , like Alan Turing .
However , if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that &#91; fly &#93; , you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines .
And so , several years ago , I under@@ took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence .
Let &apos;s take a step back .
Let &apos;s first begin with a thought experiment .
P@@ ret@@ end that you &apos;re an alien race that doesn &apos;t know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence , but you have amazing telescopes and you &apos;re able to watch the Earth , and you have amazingly long lives , so you &apos;re able to watch the Earth over millions , even billions of years .
And you observe a really strange effect .
You observe that , over the course of the millennia , Earth is continually bombar@@ ded with asteroids up until a point , and that at some point , correspon@@ ding roughly to our year , 2000 A@@ D , asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have colli@@ ded mysteri@@ ously get def@@ lec@@ ted or they de@@ ton@@ ate before they can hit the Earth .
Now of course , as earth@@ lings , we know the reason would be that we &apos;re trying to save ourselves .
We &apos;re trying to prevent an impact .
But if you &apos;re an alien race who doesn &apos;t know any of this , doesn &apos;t have any concept of Earth intelligence , you &apos;d be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how , up until a certain point in time , asteroids that would demo@@ lish the surface of a planet mysteri@@ ously stop doing that .
And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence .
So in this program that I under@@ took several years ago , I looked at a variety of different thre@@ ads across science , across a variety of disciplines , that were pointing , I think , towards a single , underlying mechanism for intelligence .
And so , taking all of these different thre@@ ads and putting them together , I asked , starting several years ago , is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different thre@@ ads ?
Is there a single equation for intelligence ?
And the answer , I believe , is yes . &#91; &quot; F = T ∇ S@@ τ &quot; &#93; What you &apos;re seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E = m@@ c ² for intelligence that I &apos;ve seen .
So what you &apos;re seeing here is a statement of correspon@@ dence that intelligence is a force , F , that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action .
It acts to maximize future freedom of action , or keep options open , with some strength T , with the diversity of possible accessible fut@@ ures , S , up to some future time horizon , ta@@ u .
In short , intelligence doesn &apos;t like to get trapped .
Intelli@@ gence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open .
And so , given this one equation , it &apos;s natural to ask , so what can you do with this ?
How predic@@ tive is it ?
Does it predict human-@@ level intelligence ?
Does it predict artificial intelligence ?
So I &apos;m going to show you now a video that will , I think , demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equation .
But what if that tent@@ ative cosm@@ ological connection between entropy and intelligence hin@@ ts at a deeper relationship ?
What if intelligent behavior doesn &apos;t just cor@@ relate with the production of long-term entropy , but actually emerges directly from it ?
To find out , we developed a software engine called En@@ tropic@@ a , designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy of any system that it finds itself in .
Amaz@@ ingly , En@@ tropic@@ a was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests , play human games , and even earn money trading stocks , all without being instruc@@ ted to do so .
Here are some examples of En@@ tropic@@ a in action .
Just like a human standing upright without falling over , here we see En@@ tropic@@ a automatically balan@@ cing a pole using a cart .
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave En@@ tropic@@ a a goal .
It simply decided on its own to balance the pole .
This balan@@ cing ability will have appli@@ actions for human@@ oid robotics and human assist@@ ive technologies .
Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces , here we see that En@@ tropic@@ a , again on its own initiative , was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk , representing a tool , to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position .
This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture .
In addition , just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food , here we see that En@@ tropic@@ a is able to accomplish a model version of that task .
This cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields .
En@@ tropic@@ a is broadly applic@@ able to a variety of dom@@ a@@ ins .
For example , here we see it successfully playing a game of p@@ ong against itself , illu@@ strating its potential for g@@ aming .
Here we see En@@ tropic@@ a orchest@@ rating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected .
This same network orchest@@ ration ability also has applications in health care , energy , and intelligence .
Here we see En@@ tropic@@ a direc@@ ting the paths of a fle@@ et of ships , successfully discovering and utili@@ zing the Pan@@ ama Can@@ al to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific .
By the same to@@ ken , En@@ tropic@@ a is broadly applic@@ able to problems in autonomous defense , logist@@ ics and transportation .
Finally , here we see En@@ tropic@@ a spontaneously discovering and exec@@ uting a bu@@ y-@@ low , s@@ ell-@@ high strategy on a simulated range tra@@ ded stock , successfully growing assets under management exponentially .
This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance .
Alex Wis@@ s@@ ner-@@ Gr@@ oss : So what you &apos;ve just seen is that a variety of signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright and social cooperation all follow from a single equation , which drives a system to maximize its future freedom of action .
Now , there &apos;s a profound irony here .
Going back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot , the play &quot; R@@ U@@ R , &quot; there was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence , there would be a cyber@@ ne@@ tic revol@@ t .
The machines would rise up against us .
One major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades , we &apos;ve had the whole concept of cyber@@ ne@@ tic revol@@ t in reverse .
It &apos;s not that machines first become intelligent and then me@@ gal@@ om@@ ani@@ ac@@ al and try to take over the world .
Another important consequence is goal seeking .
I &apos;m often asked , how does the ability to seek goals follow from this sort of framework ?
Finally , Richard Feynman , famous physicist , once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our des@@ cen@@ dants to help them rebuild civilization , that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they &apos;re far apart but re@@ pel each other when they &apos;re close together .
My equivalent of that statement to pass on to des@@ cen@@ dants to help them build artificial intelligen@@ ces or to help them understand human intelligence , is the following : Intelli@@ gence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future .
Thank you very much .
