When I was in my 20s , I saw my very first psycho@@ therapy client .
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley .
She was a 2@@ 6@@ -year-old woman named Alex .
Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big sl@@ ou@@ chy top , and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her fl@@ ats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems .
Now when I heard this , I was so relie@@ ved .
My class@@ mate got an ar@@ son@@ ist for her first client .
And I got a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something who wanted to talk about boys .
This I thought I could handle .
But I didn &apos;t handle it .
With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session , it was easy for me just to no@@ d my head while we kicked the can down the road .
&quot; Thir@@ ty &apos;s the new 20 , &quot; Alex would say , and as far as I could tell , she was right .
Work happened later , marriage happened later , kids happened later , even death happened later .
Tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things like Alex and I had nothing but time .
But before long , my super@@ vis@@ or pushed me to push Alex about her love life .
I pushed back .
I said , &quot; Sure , she &apos;s dating down , she &apos;s sleeping with a k@@ nu@@ ck@@ leh@@ ead , but it &apos;s not like she &apos;s going to marry the guy . &quot;
And then my super@@ vis@@ or said , &quot; Not yet , but she might marry the next one .
Bes@@ i@@ des , the best time to work on Alex &apos;s marriage is before she has one . &quot;
That &apos;s what psychologists call an &quot; Aha ! &quot; moment .
That was the moment I realized , 30 is not the new 20 .
Yes , people settle down later than they used to , but that didn &apos;t make Alex &apos;s 20s a developmental down@@ time .
That made Alex &apos;s 20s a developmental sweet spot , and we were sitting there blowing it .
That was when I realized that this sort of benign neg@@ lect was a real problem , and it had real consequences , not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the fut@@ ures of tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things everywhere .
There are 50 million tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things in the United States right now .
We &apos;re talking about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you consider that no one &apos;s getting through adul@@ thood without going through their 20s first .
Ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;re in your 20s .
I really want to see some tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things here .
Oh , y@@ ay ! Y &apos;@@ all &apos;s awesome .
If you work with tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things , you love a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something , you &apos;re losing sleep over tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things , I want to see — Okay . A@@ wesome , tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things really matter .
So I speci@@ alize in tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things because I believe that every single one of those 50 million tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things deserves to know what psychologists , soci@@ ologists , neuro@@ lo@@ gi@@ sts and fertility specialists already know : that claim@@ ing your 20s is one of the simplest , yet most transformative , things you can do for work , for love , for your happiness , maybe even for the world .
This is not my opinion . These are the facts .
We know that 80 percent of life &apos;s most defining moments take place by age 35 .
That means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and &quot; Aha ! &quot; moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid-@@ 30s .
People who are over 40 , don &apos;t panic .
This crowd is going to be fine , I think .
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you &apos;re going to earn .
We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30 .
We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth sp@@ urt in your 20s as it re@@ wires itself for adul@@ thood , which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself , now is the time to change it .
We know that personality changes more during your 20s than at any other time in life , and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28 , and things get tricky after age 35 .
So your 20s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options .
So when we think about child development , we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain .
It &apos;s a time when your ordinary , day-to-day life has an in@@ ordin@@ ate impact on who you will become .
But what we hear less about is that there &apos;s such a thing as adult development , and our 20s are that critical period of adult development .
But this isn &apos;t what tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things are hearing .
New@@ sp@@ apers talk about the changing tim@@ et@@ able of adul@@ thood .
Resear@@ chers call the 20s an extended adolescence .
Journ@@ alists coin silly nick@@ names for tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things like &quot; twi@@ x@@ ters &quot; and &quot; kid@@ ults . &quot;
It &apos;s true .
As a culture , we have trivi@@ alized what is actually the defining decade of adul@@ thood .
Leon@@ ard Bern@@ stein said that to achieve great things , you need a plan and not quite enough time .
Isn &apos;t that true ?
So what do you think happens when you p@@ at a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something on the head and you say , &quot; You have 10 extra years to start your life &quot; ?
Nothing happens .
You have rob@@ bed that person of his ur@@ gency and ambition , and absolutely nothing happens .
And then every day , smart , interesting tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this : &quot; I know my boyfriend &apos;s no good for me , but this relationship doesn &apos;t count . I &apos;m just killing time . &quot;
Or they say , &quot; Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time I &apos;m 30 , I &apos;ll be fine . &quot;
But then it starts to sound like this : &quot; My 20s are almost over , and I have nothing to show for myself .
I had a better r@@ é@@ sum@@ é the day after I graduated from college . &quot;
And then it starts to sound like this : &quot; D@@ ating in my 20s was like musical chairs .
Everybody was running around and having fun , but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down .
I didn &apos;t want to be the only one left standing up , so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at 30 . &quot;
Where are the tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things here ?
Do not do that .
Okay , now that sounds a little flip , but make no mistake , the stakes are very high .
When a lot has been pushed to your 30s , there is enormous thir@@ ty@@ something pressure to jump@@ -@@ start a career , pick a city , partner up , and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time .
Many of these things are in@@ compatible , and as research is just starting to show , simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s .
The post-@@ millenni@@ al mid@@ life crisis isn &apos;t buying a red sports car .
It &apos;s realizing you can &apos;t have that career you now want .
It &apos;s realizing you can &apos;t have that child you now want , or you can &apos;t give your child a si@@ bling .
Too many thir@@ ty@@ some@@ things and fort@@ y@@ some@@ things look at themselves , and at me , sitting across the room , and say about their 20s , &quot; What was I doing ? What was I thinking ? &quot;
I want to change what tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things are doing and thinking .
Here &apos;s a story about how that can go .
It &apos;s a story about a woman named Emma .
At 25 , Emma came to my office because she was , in her words , having an identity crisis .
She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided yet , so she &apos;d spent the last few years waiting tables instead .
Because it was cheaper , she lived with a boyfriend who dis@@ played his tem@@ per more than his ambition .
And as hard as her 20s were , her early life had been even harder .
She often cried in our sessions , but then would collect herself by saying , &quot; You can &apos;t pick your family , but you can pick your friends . &quot;
Well one day , Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap , and she so@@ b@@ bed for most of the hour .
She &apos;d just bought a new address book , and she &apos;d spent the morning filling in her many contacts , but then she &apos;d been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words &quot; In case of emergency , please call ... . &quot;
She was nearly hy@@ ster@@ ical when she looked at me and said , &quot; Who &apos;s going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck ?
Who &apos;s going to take care of me if I have cancer ? &quot;
Now in that moment , it took everything I had not to say , &quot; I will . &quot;
But what Emma needed wasn &apos;t some therapist who really , really cared .
Emma needed a better life , and I knew this was her chance .
I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex to just sit there while Emma &apos;s defining decade went par@@ ading by .
So over the next weeks and months , I told Emma three things that every tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something , male or female , deserves to hear .
First , I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital .
By get identity capital , I mean do something that adds value to who you are .
Do something that &apos;s an investment in who you might want to be next .
I didn &apos;t know the future of Emma &apos;s career , and no one knows the future of work , but I do know this : Identi@@ ty capital be@@ gets identity capital .
So now is the time for that cross-@@ country job , that intern@@ ship , that star@@ tu@@ p you want to try .
I &apos;m not dis@@ counting tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something exploration here , but I am dis@@ counting exploration that &apos;s not supposed to count , which , by the way , is not exploration .
That &apos;s pro@@ cra@@ st@@ ination .
I told Emma to explore work and make it count .
Second , I told Emma that the urban tribe is over@@ rated .
Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport , but tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things who hu@@ ddle together with lik@@ e-@@ minded peers limit who they know , what they know , how they think , how they speak , and where they work .
That new piece of capital , that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle .
New things come from what are called our weak ties , our friends of friends of friends .
So yes , half of tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things are un@@ - or under-@@ employed .
But half aren &apos;t , and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group .
Half of new jobs are never posted , so reaching out to your neighbor &apos;s boss is how you get that un-@@ posted job .
It &apos;s not cheating . It &apos;s the science of how information spreads .
Last but not least , Emma believed that you can &apos;t pick your family , but you can pick your friends .
Now this was true for her growing up , but as a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something , soon Emma would pick her family when she partner@@ ed with someone and created a family of her own .
I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now .
Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20 , or even 25 , and I agree with you .
But grab@@ bing whoever you &apos;re living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the ais@@ le is not progress .
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one , and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work .
Pic@@ king your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you .
So what happened to Emma ?
Well , we went through that address book , and she found an old room@@ mate &apos;s cousin who worked at an art museum in another state .
That weak tie helped her get a job there .
That job offer gave her the reason to leave that li@@ ve-@@ in boyfriend .
Now , five years later , she &apos;s a special events plan@@ ner for museums .
She &apos;s married to a man she mind@@ fully chose .
She loves her new career , she loves her new family , and she sent me a card that said , &quot; Now the emergency contact blan@@ ks don &apos;t seem big enough . &quot;
Now Emma &apos;s story made that sound easy , but that &apos;s what I love about working with tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things .
They are so easy to help .
Tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things are like airplanes just leaving L@@ A@@ X , bound for somewhere west .
Right after ta@@ ke@@ off , a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fi@@ ji .
L@@ ik@@ e@@ wise , at 21 or 25 or even 29 , one good conversation , one good break , one good TED Talk , can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come .
So here &apos;s an idea worth spreading to every tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something you know .
It &apos;s as simple as what I learned to say to Alex .
It &apos;s what I now have the privilege of saying to tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things like Emma every single day : Thir@@ ty is not the new 20 , so claim your adul@@ thood , get some identity capital , use your weak ties , pick your family .
Don &apos;t be defined by what you didn &apos;t know or didn &apos;t do .
You &apos;re deciding your life right now .
Thank you .
Through@@ out the history of computers we &apos;ve been stri@@ ving to shor@@ ten the gap between us and digital information , the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild .
And this gap has become shorter , shorter , and even shorter , and now this gap is shor@@ ten@@ ed down to less than a millimeter , the th@@ ick@@ ness of a tou@@ ch-@@ screen glass , and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone .
But I wondered , what if there could be no boundary at all ?
I started to imagine what this would look like .
First , I created this tool which penet@@ rates into the digital space , so when you press it hard on the screen , it trans@@ fers its physical body into pix@@ els .
Desig@@ ners can materi@@ alize their ideas directly in 3D , and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen .
So with this tool , this boundary has been broken .
But our two hands still remain outside the screen .
How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity of our hands ?
At Microsoft App@@ lied Sci@@ ences , along with my mentor C@@ ati Bou@@ langer , I re@@ designed the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital work@@ space .
By combin@@ ing a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face , now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach inside this 3D space and grab pix@@ els with your bare hands .
Because windows and files have a position in the real space , sel@@ ecting them is as easy as grab@@ bing a book off your shelf .
Then you can flip through this book while high@@ lighting the lines , words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window .
Archit@@ ects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly .
So in these examples , we are reaching into the digital world .
But how about revers@@ ing its role and having the digital information reach us instead ?
I &apos;m sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online .
But now you don &apos;t have to worry about it .
What I got here is an online aug@@ mented fitting room .
This is a view that you get from head-@@ moun@@ ted or se@@ e-@@ through display when the system understands the geometry of your body .
Ta@@ king this idea further , I started to think , instead of just seeing these pix@@ els in our space , how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it ?
What would such a future look like ?
At MIT Media Lab , along with my advis@@ or Hiros@@ hi I@@ shi@@ i and my collabor@@ ator Reh@@ mi Post , we created this one physical pix@@ el .
Well , in this case , this sp@@ her@@ ical magnet acts like a 3D pix@@ el in our space , which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little 3D space .
What we did was essentially can@@ cel@@ ing gravity and controlling the movement by combin@@ ing magnetic le@@ vit@@ ation and mechanical ac@@ tu@@ ation and sensing technologies .
And by digit@@ ally programming the object , we are liber@@ ating the object from constraints of time and space , which means that now , human mo@@ tions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world .
So chore@@ ography can be taught physically over distance and Michael Jordan &apos;s famous shooting can be replic@@ ated over and over as a physical reality .
Students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion , physics , and unlike computer screens or textbooks , this is a real , tangible experience that you can touch and feel , and it &apos;s very powerful .
And what &apos;s more exciting than just turning what &apos;s currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities .
As you can see , the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without dis@@ connecting ourselves from our world .
Today , we started by talking about the boundary , but if we remove this boundary , the only boundary left is our imagination .
Thank you .
So I was trained to become a gy@@ mn@@ ast for two years in Hun@@ an , China in the 1970s .
When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all exp@@ enses paid .
But my tiger mother said , &quot; No . &quot;
My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
After surviving the C@@ ultural Revolution , they firmly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-@@ paid job .
It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer .
That is me playing my imaginary piano .
An opera singer must start training young to learn ac@@ rob@@ ati@@ cs , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
But no adults liked the idea .
No adults believed I was serious .
Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was .
So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
My dream would never come true .
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-@@ class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so unfair .
So I was determined to find another calling .
Nobody around to teach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to books .
I satisfied my hunger for par@@ ental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; Cor@@ respon@@ dence in the Fam@@ ily of F@@ ou Le@@ i &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Con@@ fu@@ cian tradition requires obe@@ di@@ ence . &#91; &quot; Jane E@@ y@@ re &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; Che@@ aper by the Do@@ zen &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these .
&#91; &quot; Com@@ ple@@ te Wor@@ ks of San@@ ma@@ o &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; L@@ ess@@ ons From History &quot; by N@@ an Hu@@ ai@@ j@@ in &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?
Boo@@ ks banned in China , of course .
&quot; The Good Earth &quot; is about Chinese pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not convenient for propaganda . Got it .
The Bible is interesting , but strange .
That &apos;s a topic for a different day .
But the fifth command@@ ment gave me an epi@@ phany : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
&quot; Hon@@ or , &quot; I said . &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obe@@ y . &quot;
So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Con@@ fu@@ cian guilt trap and to re@@ start my relationship with my parents .
En@@ counter@@ ing a new culture also started my habit of compar@@ ative reading .
It offers many insights .
For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
Com@@ par@@ ative reading actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a standard practice in the academic world .
There are even research fields such as compar@@ ative religion and compar@@ ative literature .
Comp@@ are and contrast gives schol@@ ars a more complete understanding of a topic .
So I thought , well , if compar@@ ative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
So I started reading books in pairs .
So they can be about people -- &#91; &quot; Benjamin Franklin &quot; by Walter Isa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; John Adams &quot; by David McC@@ ull@@ ough &#93; -- who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
&#91; &quot; Personal History &quot; by K@@ ath@@ ar@@ ine Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; The Snow@@ ball : Warren Buff@@ ett and the Business of Life , &quot; by Alice Sch@@ ro@@ eder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different gen@@ res -- &#91; Holy Bible : King James Version &#93; &#91; &quot; Lam@@ b &quot; by Chr@@ is@@ op@@ her Moore &#93; -- or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Camp@@ bell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; The Power of My@@ th &quot; by Joseph Camp@@ bell &#93; For example , both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temp@@ tations .
For the Christ , the temp@@ tations are economic , political and spiritual .
For the Buddha , they are all psychological : l@@ ust , fear and social duty -- interesting .
So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
&#91; &quot; The Way of Chu@@ ang T@@ zu &quot; Thomas Mer@@ ton &#93; &#91; &quot; Ta@@ o : The Wat@@ er@@ course Way &quot; Alan Wat@@ ts &#93; Instead of lost in translation , I found there is much to gain .
For example , it &apos;s through translation that I realized &quot; happiness &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; fast joy . &quot; Huh !
&quot; Bri@@ de &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; new mother . &quot; U@@ h-@@ oh .
Boo@@ ks have given me a magic port@@ al to connect with people of the past and the present .
I know I shall never feel lonely or power@@ less again .
Having a dream sh@@ attered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
Even a sh@@ attered dream can do that for you .
So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
So may books be always with you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So when I was eight years old , a new girl came to join the class , and she was so impressive , as the new girl always seems to be .
She had vast quantities of very sh@@ iny hair and a cute little pencil case , super strong on state capit@@ als , just a great sp@@ eller .
And I just cur@@ d@@ led with je@@ al@@ ousy that year , until I hat@@ ched my de@@ vious plan .
So one day I stayed a little late after school , a little too late , and I l@@ ur@@ ked in the girls &apos; bathroom .
When the coast was clear , I emerged , cre@@ pt into the classroom , and took from my teacher &apos;s desk the grade book .
And then I did it .
I fi@@ ddled with my ri@@ val &apos;s grades , just a little , just dem@@ oted some of those A &apos;s .
All of those A &apos;s .
And I got ready to return the book to the dra@@ wer , when hang on , some of my other class@@ mates had app@@ all@@ ingly good grades too .
So , in a fr@@ enz@@ y , I correc@@ ted everybody &apos;s marks , not imagin@@ atively .
I gave everybody a row of D &apos;s and I gave myself a row of A &apos;s , just because I was there , you know , might as well .
And I am still b@@ aff@@ led by my behavior .
I don &apos;t understand where the idea came from .
I don &apos;t understand why I felt so great doing it .
I felt great .
I don &apos;t understand why I was never caught .
I mean , it should have been so bl@@ at@@ antly obvious .
I was never caught .
But most of all , I am b@@ aff@@ led by , why did it bother me so much that this little girl , this tiny little girl , was so good at sp@@ elling ?
Je@@ al@@ ousy b@@ aff@@ les me .
It &apos;s so mysterious , and it &apos;s so pervasive .
We know babies suffer from je@@ al@@ ousy .
We know primates do . Blu@@ e@@ birds are actually very pr@@ one .
We know that je@@ al@@ ousy is the number one cause of sp@@ ous@@ al murder in the United States .
And yet , I have never read a study that can par@@ se to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thri@@ ll .
For that , we have to go to fiction , because the novel is the lab that has studied je@@ al@@ ousy in every possible configuration .
In fact , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s an exagger@@ ation to say that if we didn &apos;t have je@@ al@@ ousy , would we even have literature ?
Well no fai@@ th@@ less Helen , no &quot; Odys@@ sey . &quot;
No je@@ al@@ ous king , no &quot; Arab@@ ian Nig@@ h@@ ts . &quot;
No Shakespeare .
There goes high school reading lists , because we &apos;re losing &quot; Sound and the F@@ ury , &quot; we &apos;re losing &quot; G@@ ats@@ by , &quot; &quot; Sun Also Ris@@ es , &quot; we &apos;re losing &quot; Mad@@ ame Bo@@ vary , &quot; &quot; An@@ na K. &quot;
No je@@ al@@ ousy , no P@@ rou@@ st . And now , I mean , I know it &apos;s fashi@@ on@@ able to say that P@@ rou@@ st has the answers to everything , but in the case of je@@ al@@ ousy , he kind of does .
This year is the cent@@ enni@@ al of his master@@ piece , &quot; In S@@ ear@@ ch of L@@ ost Time , &quot; and it &apos;s the most exhau@@ st@@ ive study of sexual je@@ al@@ ousy and just regular competi@@ tiveness , my brand , that we can hope to have .
And we think about P@@ rou@@ st , we think about the sentim@@ ental bits , right ?
We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep .
We think about a ma@@ del@@ eine mo@@ ist@@ ened in la@@ ven@@ der tea .
We forget how harsh his vision was .
We forget how pi@@ ti@@ less he is .
I mean , these are books that Virginia Wo@@ ol@@ f said were tough as cat gut .
I don &apos;t know what cat gut is , but let &apos;s assume it &apos;s for@@ mid@@ able .
Let &apos;s look at why they go so well together , the novel and je@@ al@@ ousy , je@@ al@@ ousy and P@@ rou@@ st .
Is it something as obvious as that je@@ al@@ ousy , which bo@@ ils down into person , desire , im@@ pedi@@ ment , is such a solid narrative foundation ?
I don &apos;t know . I think it cuts very close to the bone , because let &apos;s think about what happens when we feel je@@ al@@ ous .
When we feel je@@ al@@ ous , we tell ourselves a story .
We tell ourselves a story about other people &apos;s lives , and these stories make us feel terrible because they &apos;re designed to make us feel terrible .
As the t@@ eller of the tale and the audience , we know just what details to include , to dig that knife in . Right ?
Je@@ al@@ ousy makes us all amateur novel@@ ists , and this is something P@@ rou@@ st understood .
In the first volume , S@@ wann &apos;s Way , the series of books , S@@ wann , one of the main characters , is thinking very fon@@ dly of his mist@@ ress and how great she is in bed , and suddenly , in the course of a few sentences , and these are P@@ rou@@ st@@ ian sentences , so they &apos;re long as rivers , but in the course of a few sentences , he suddenly reco@@ ils and he reali@@ zes , &quot; Hang on , everything I love about this woman , somebody else would love about this woman .
Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure , maybe right about now . &quot;
And this is the story he starts to tell himself , and from then on , P@@ rou@@ st writes that every fresh char@@ m S@@ wann det@@ ects in his mist@@ ress , he adds to his &quot; collection of instruments in his private torture chamber . &quot;
Now S@@ wann and P@@ rou@@ st , we have to admit , were not@@ ori@@ ously je@@ al@@ ous .
You know , P@@ rou@@ st &apos;s boy@@ friends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him .
But you don &apos;t have to be that je@@ al@@ ous to con@@ ce@@ de that it &apos;s hard work . Right ?
Je@@ al@@ ousy is exhau@@ sting .
It &apos;s a hungry emotion . It must be fed .
And what does je@@ al@@ ousy like ?
Je@@ al@@ ousy likes information .
Je@@ al@@ ousy likes details .
Je@@ al@@ ousy likes the vast quantities of sh@@ iny hair , the cute little pencil case .
Je@@ al@@ ousy likes photos .
That &apos;s why Inst@@ ag@@ ram is such a hit .
P@@ rou@@ st actually links the language of scholarship and je@@ al@@ ousy .
When S@@ wann is in his je@@ al@@ ous thro@@ es , and suddenly he &apos;s listening at door@@ ways and bri@@ bing his mist@@ ress &apos; ser@@ van@@ ts , he def@@ ends these behaviors .
He says , &quot; You know , look , I know you think this is re@@ pu@@ gn@@ ant , but it is no different from interpre@@ ting an ancient text or looking at a mon@@ ument . &quot;
He says , &quot; They are scientific investig@@ ations with real intellectual value . &quot;
P@@ rou@@ st is trying to show us that je@@ al@@ ousy feels in@@ toler@@ able and makes us look absurd , but it is , at its cru@@ x , a quest for knowledge , a quest for truth , painful truth , and actually , where P@@ rou@@ st is concerned , the more painful the truth , the better .
G@@ rief , humiliation , loss : These were the aven@@ ues to wisdom for P@@ rou@@ st .
He says , &quot; A woman whom we need , who makes us suffer , el@@ ic@@ its from us a gam@@ ut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us . &quot;
Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women ?
No . I think he &apos;s trying to say that je@@ al@@ ousy reveals us to ourselves .
And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way ?
Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggres@@ sion and our hi@@ de@@ ous ambition and our enti@@ t@@ lement ?
Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity ?
Freud would write about this later .
One day , Freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him .
And Freud says , it &apos;s something strange about this guy , because he &apos;s not looking at what his wife is doing .
Because she &apos;s bl@@ am@@ eless ; everybody knows it .
The poor creature is just under suspic@@ ion for no cause .
But he &apos;s looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing , un@@ intentional behaviors .
Is she smiling too bri@@ ghtly here , or did she acci@@ dentally brush up against a man there ?
&#91; Freud &#93; says that the man is becoming the cu@@ sto@@ dian of his wife &apos;s unconscious .
The novel is very good on this point .
The novel is very good at describing how je@@ al@@ ousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy .
In fact , the more inten@@ sely je@@ al@@ ous we are , the more we become residents of fantasy .
And this is why , I think , je@@ al@@ ousy doesn &apos;t just provo@@ ke us to do violent things or illegal things .
Je@@ al@@ ousy promp@@ ts us to behave in ways that are wil@@ dly inv@@ enti@@ ve .
Now I &apos;m thinking of myself at eight , I con@@ ce@@ de , but I &apos;m also thinking of this story I heard on the news .
A 5@@ 2@@ -year-old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vi@@ le , hi@@ de@@ ous messages to herself for a year .
For a year . A year .
And she was trying to frame her ex-@@ boyfriend &apos;s new girlfriend , and I have to conf@@ ess when I heard this , I just re@@ acted with admi@@ ration .
Because , I mean , let &apos;s be real .
What immense , if mis@@ placed , creativity . Right ?
This is something from a novel .
This is something from a Patri@@ cia High@@ s@@ mith novel .
Now High@@ s@@ mith is a particular favorite of mine .
She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters .
She &apos;s the author of &quot; Str@@ ang@@ ers on a Tra@@ in &quot; and &quot; The Tal@@ ented Mr. Ri@@ ple@@ y , &quot; books that are all about how je@@ al@@ ousy , it mu@@ dd@@ les our minds , and once we &apos;re in the sphere , in that realm of je@@ al@@ ousy , the membrane between what is and what could be can be p@@ ier@@ ced in an instant .
Take Tom Ri@@ ple@@ y , her most famous character .
Now , Tom Ri@@ ple@@ y goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had , and you &apos;re under the flo@@ or@@ boards , he &apos;s answering to your name , he &apos;s wearing your rings , emp@@ t@@ ying your bank account .
That &apos;s one way to go .
But what do we do ? We can &apos;t go the Tom Ri@@ ple@@ y route .
I can &apos;t give the world D &apos;s , as much as I would really like to , some days .
And it &apos;s a pity , because we live in en@@ vious times .
We live in je@@ al@@ ous times .
I mean , we &apos;re all good citizens of social media , aren &apos;t we , where the currency is envy ?
Does the novel show us a way out ? I &apos;m not sure .
So let &apos;s do what characters always do when they &apos;re not sure , when they are in pos@@ session of a mystery .
Let &apos;s go to 2@@ 21@@ B B@@ aker Street and ask for Sher@@ lock Hol@@ mes .
When people think of Hol@@ mes , they think of his ne@@ mes@@ is being Professor M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty , right , this criminal master@@ mind .
But I &apos;ve always preferred &#91; In@@ spec@@ tor &#93; L@@ est@@ ra@@ de , who is the rat@@ -@@ faced head of Scotland Y@@ ard who needs Hol@@ mes desperately , needs Hol@@ mes &apos; genius , but res@@ ents him .
Oh , it &apos;s so familiar to me .
So L@@ est@@ ra@@ de needs his help , res@@ ents him , and sort of se@@ eth@@ es with bit@@ ter@@ ness over the course of the mysteries .
But as they work together , something starts to change , and finally in &quot; The Ad@@ venture of the Six Nap@@ ol@@ e@@ ons , &quot; once Hol@@ mes comes in , da@@ zz@@ les everybody with his solution , L@@ est@@ ra@@ de turns to Hol@@ mes and he says , &quot; We &apos;re not je@@ al@@ ous of you , Mr. Hol@@ mes .
We &apos;re proud of you . &quot;
And he says that there &apos;s not a man at Scotland Y@@ ard who wouldn &apos;t want to shake Sher@@ lock Hol@@ mes &apos; hand .
It &apos;s one of the few times we see Hol@@ mes moved in the mysteries , and I find it very moving , this little scene , but it &apos;s also mysterious , right ?
It seems to treat je@@ al@@ ousy as a problem of geometry , not emotion .
You know , one minute Hol@@ mes is on the other side from L@@ est@@ ra@@ de .
The next minute they &apos;re on the same side .
Suddenly , L@@ est@@ ra@@ de is letting himself admire this mind that he &apos;s res@@ ented .
Could it be so simple though ?
What if je@@ al@@ ousy really is a matter of geometry , just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another ?
Well , maybe then we wouldn &apos;t have to res@@ ent somebody &apos;s excellence .
We could al@@ ign ourselves with it .
But I like contin@@ gency plans .
So while we wait for that to happen , let us remember that we have fiction for con@@ sol@@ ation .
Fiction alone de@@ my@@ sti@@ fies je@@ al@@ ousy .
Fiction alone domest@@ ic@@ ates it , inv@@ ites it to the table .
And look who it ga@@ thers : sweet L@@ est@@ ra@@ de , terrifying Tom Ri@@ ple@@ y , crazy S@@ wann , Mar@@ c@@ el P@@ rou@@ st himself .
We are in excellent company .
Thank you .
I was about 10 years old on a camp@@ ing trip with my dad in the Adi@@ ron@@ d@@ ack Mountains , a wil@@ derness area in the northern part of New York State .
It was a beautiful day .
The forest was spar@@ kling .
The sun made the leaves glow like sta@@ ined glass , and if it weren &apos;t for the path we were following , we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land .
We got to our camp@@ site .
It was a le@@ an-@@ to on a blu@@ ff looking over a crystal , beautiful lake , when I discovered a horror .
Behind the le@@ an-@@ to was a dump , maybe 40 feet square with ro@@ tting apple cor@@ es and bal@@ le@@ d-@@ up aluminum fo@@ il , and a dead sne@@ aker .
And I was aston@@ ished , I was very angry , and I was deeply confused .
The cam@@ pers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in , who did they think would clean up after them ?
That question stayed with me , and it simpli@@ fied a little .
Who cle@@ ans up after us ?
However you con@@ figure or wherever you place the us , who cle@@ ans up after us in Istanbul ?
Who cle@@ ans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London ?
Here in New York , the Department of San@@ itation cle@@ ans up after us , to the tune of 1@@ 1,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recy@@ cl@@ ables every day .
I wanted to get to know them as individuals .
I wanted to understand who takes the job .
What &apos;s it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden ?
So I started a research project with them .
I ro@@ de in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city , and I learned a lot , but I was still an out@@ sider .
I needed to go deeper .
So I took the job as a sanitation worker .
I didn &apos;t just ride in the trucks now . I drove the trucks .
And I operated the mechanical bro@@ oms and I p@@ lowed the snow .
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education .
Everyone asks about the smell .
It &apos;s there , but it &apos;s not as pre@@ valent as you think , and on days when it is really bad , you get used to it rather quickly .
The weight takes a long time to get used to .
I knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adju@@ sting to the burden of be@@ aring on your body tons of trash every week .
Then there &apos;s the danger .
According to the Bu@@ re@@ au of Labor Statist@@ ics , sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occup@@ ations in the country , and I learned why .
You &apos;re in and out of traffic all day , and it &apos;s zo@@ oming around you .
It just wants to get past you , so it &apos;s often the motor@@ ist is not paying attention .
That &apos;s really bad for the worker .
And then the garbage itself is full of haz@@ ards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm .
I also learned about the rel@@ ent@@ lessness of trash .
When you step off the cur@@ b and you see a city from behind a truck , you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature un@@ to itself .
It never stops coming .
It &apos;s also like a form of res@@ pi@@ ration or circulation .
It must always be in motion .
And then there &apos;s the stigma .
You put on the uniform , and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you &apos;ve blocked traffic with your truck , or you &apos;re taking a break too close to their home , or you &apos;re drinking coffee in their din@@ er , and they will come and sc@@ orn you , and tell you that they don &apos;t want you anywhere near them .
I find the stigma especially ironic , because I strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city , for three reasons .
They are the first guar@@ di@@ ans of public health .
If they &apos;re not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day , it starts to spill out of its contain@@ ments , and the dan@@ gers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways .
Dis@@ eases we &apos;ve had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us .
The economy needs them .
If we can &apos;t throw out the old stuff , we have no room for the new stuff , so then the engines of the economy start to sp@@ utter when consumption is com@@ promised .
I &apos;m not advoc@@ ating capitalism , I &apos;m just pointing out their relationship .
And then there &apos;s what I call our average , necessary qu@@ oti@@ dian velocity .
By that I simply mean how fast we &apos;re used to moving in the contemporary day and age .
We usually don &apos;t care for , repair , clean , carry around our coffee cup , our shopping bag , our bottle of water .
We use them , we throw them out , we forget about them , because we know there &apos;s a workforce on the other side that &apos;s going to take it all away .
So I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help am@@ el@@ ior@@ ate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane .
Their work , I think , is kind of li@@ tur@@ gical .
They &apos;re on the streets every day , rhyth@@ m@@ ically .
They wear a uniform in many cities .
You know when to expect them .
And their work lets us do our work .
They are almost a form of reass@@ ur@@ ance .
The flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves , from our own dr@@ oss , our cast@@ -@@ offs , and that flow must be main@@ tained always no matter what .
On the day after September 11 in 2001 , I heard the grow@@ l of a sanitation truck on the street , and I grabbed my infant son and I ran down@@ stairs and there was a man doing his paper recycling route like he did every We@@ d@@ nes@@ day .
And I tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days , but I started to cry .
And he looked at me , and he just no@@ d@@ ded , and he said , &quot; We &apos;re going to be okay .
We &apos;re going to be okay . &quot;
It was a little while later that I started my research with sanitation , and I met that man again .
His name is Pau@@ lie , and we worked together many times , and we became good friends .
I want to believe that Pau@@ lie was right .
We are going to be okay .
But in our effort to recon@@ figure how we as a species exist on this planet , we must include and take account of all the costs , including the very real human cost of the labor .
And we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about , how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from cur@@ b@@ side recycling , which is a remarkable success across 40 years , across the United States and countries around the world , and lift us up to a broader horizon where we &apos;re looking at other forms of waste that could be l@@ essen@@ ed from manufacturing and industrial sources .
M@@ un@@ ici@@ p@@ al waste , what we think of when we talk about garbage , accounts for three percent of the nation &apos;s waste stream .
It &apos;s a remarkable statistic .
So in the flow of your days , in the flow of your lives , next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you , take a moment to acknowledge them .
Take a moment to say thank you .
Hello , TEDWomen , what &apos;s up .
Not good enough .
Hello , TEDWomen , what is up ?
My name is May@@ soon Z@@ ay@@ id , and I am not drunk , but the doctor who delivered me was .
He cut my mom six different times in six different directions , suff@@ oc@@ ating poor little me in the process .
As a result , I have cerebral pal@@ sy , which means I shake all the time .
Look .
It &apos;s exhau@@ sting . I &apos;m like Sha@@ k@@ ir@@ a , Sha@@ k@@ ir@@ a meets Muhammad Ali .
C.@@ P. is not genetic .
It &apos;s not a birth def@@ ect . You can &apos;t catch it .
No one put a cur@@ se on my mother &apos;s u@@ ter@@ us , and I didn &apos;t get it because my parents are first cousins , which they are .
It only happens from accidents , like what happened to me on my birth day .
Now , I must war@@ n you , I &apos;m not inspi@@ rational , and I don &apos;t want anyone in this room to feel bad for me , because at some point in your life , you have dre@@ amt of being disabled .
Come on a journey with me .
It &apos;s Christmas Eve , you &apos;re at the mall , you &apos;re driving around in circles looking for parking , and what do you see ?
Six@@ teen empty han@@ dic@@ apped spaces .
And you &apos;re like , &quot; God , can &apos;t I just be a little disabled ? &quot;
Also , I gotta tell you , I got 99 problems , and pal@@ sy is just one .
If there was an Opp@@ ression Olympics , I would win the gold me@@ dal .
I &apos;m Palestinian , Muslim , I &apos;m female , I &apos;m disabled , and I live in New Jersey .
If you don &apos;t feel better about yourself , maybe you should .
Cli@@ ff@@ side Park , New Jersey is my hometown .
I have always loved the fact that my hood and my aff@@ lic@@ tion share the same initi@@ als .
I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City , I could .
A lot of people with C.@@ P. don &apos;t walk , but my parents didn &apos;t believe in &quot; can &apos;t . &quot;
My father &apos;s man@@ tra was , &quot; You can do it , yes you can can . &quot;
So , if my three older sisters were m@@ opping , I was m@@ opping .
If my three older sisters went to public school , my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that I went too , and if we didn &apos;t all get A &apos;s , we all got my mother &apos;s sli@@ pper .
My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by placing my he@@ els on his feet and just walking .
Another tac@@ tic that he used is he would dan@@ g@@ le a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it .
My inner stri@@ pper was very strong , and by -- Yeah . No , by the first day of kindergarten , I was walking like a ch@@ amp who had been pun@@ ched one too many times .
Gro@@ wing up , there were only six Arab@@ s in my town , and they were all my family .
Now there are 20 Arab@@ s in town , and they are still all my family .
I don &apos;t think anyone even noticed we weren &apos;t Italian .
This was before 9 / 11 and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use &quot; I hate Mos@@ le@@ ms &quot; as a campaign slogan .
The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith .
They did , however , seem very concerned that I would star@@ ve to death during R@@ ama@@ dan .
I would explain to them that I have enough fat to live off of for three whole months , so fa@@ sting from sun@@ rise to sun@@ set is a piece of cake .
I have tap@@ -@@ dan@@ ced on Broadway .
Yeah , on Broadway . It &apos;s crazy .
My parents couldn &apos;t afford physical therapy , so they sent me to dancing school .
I learned how to dance in he@@ els , which means I can walk in he@@ els .
And I &apos;m from Jersey , and we are really concerned with being ch@@ ic , so if my friends wore he@@ els , so did I.
And when my friends went and spent their summer vac@@ ations on the Jersey Sh@@ ore , I did not .
I spent my summ@@ ers in a war zone , because my parents were afraid that if we didn &apos;t go back to Palestine every single summer , we &apos;d grow up to be Mad@@ on@@ na .
Sum@@ mer vac@@ ations often consi@@ sted of my father trying to heal me , so I d@@ rank deer &apos;s milk , I had hot cups on my back , I was dun@@ ked in the Dead Sea , and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking , &quot; It &apos;s working ! It &apos;s working ! &quot;
But one miracle cure we did find was yog@@ a .
I have to tell you , it &apos;s very boring , but before I did yog@@ a , I was a stand@@ -up com@@ edian who can &apos;t stand up .
And now I can stand on my head .
My parents rein@@ forced this notion that I could do anything , that no dream was impossible , and my dream was to be on the day@@ time soap opera &quot; General Hospital . &quot;
I went to college during affir@@ mative action and got a sweet scholarship to AS@@ U , Arizona State University , because I fit every single quot@@ a .
I was like the pet le@@ m@@ ur of the theater department .
Everybody loved me .
I did all the less@@ -@@ th@@ an-@@ intelligent kids &apos; homework , I got A &apos;s in all of my classes , A &apos;s in all of their classes .
Every time I did a scene from &quot; The Glass Men@@ ag@@ erie , &quot; my professors would we@@ ep .
But I never got cast .
Finally , my senior year , AS@@ U decided to do a show called &quot; They D@@ ance Real Slow in Jackson . &quot;
It &apos;s a play about a girl with C.@@ P.
I was a girl with C.@@ P.
So I start shouting from the ro@@ oft@@ ops , &quot; I &apos;m finally going to get a part !
I have cerebral pal@@ sy !
Free at last ! Free at last !
Thank God al@@ mighty , I &apos;m free at last ! &quot;
I didn &apos;t get the part .
Sher@@ ry Brown got the part .
I went racing to the head of the theater department crying hy@@ ster@@ ically , like someone shot my cat , to ask her why , and she said it was because they didn &apos;t think I could do the stunts .
I said , &quot; Excuse me , if I can &apos;t do the stunts , neither can the character . &quot;
This was a part that I was literally born to play and they gave it , they gave it to a non-@@ pal@@ sy ac@@ tress .
College was imit@@ ating life .
Hollywood has a sor@@ did history of casting ab@@ le-@@ bo@@ died actors to play disabled on@@ screen .
Up@@ on gradu@@ ating , I moved back home , and my first acting gig was as an extra on a day@@ time soap opera .
My dream was coming true .
And I knew that I would be promot@@ ed from &quot; din@@ er din@@ er &quot; to &quot; wack@@ y best friend &quot; in no time .
But instead , I remained a glori@@ fied piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head , and it became clear to me that casting directors didn &apos;t hire flu@@ ff@@ y , ethnic , disabled actors .
They only hired perfect people .
But there were exceptions to the rule .
I grew up watching Who@@ op@@ i Gold@@ berg , Ros@@ e@@ anne Bar@@ r , El@@ len , and all of these women had one thing in common : they were com@@ edi@@ ans .
So I became a comic .
My first gig was driving famous comics from New York City to shows in New Jersey , and I &apos;ll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove when he realized that he was spee@@ ding down the New Jersey Tur@@ n@@ pi@@ ke with a ch@@ ick with C.@@ P. driving him .
I &apos;ve performed in clubs all over America , and I &apos;ve also performed in Arabic in the Middle East , un@@ censor@@ ed and un@@ covered .
Some people say I &apos;m the first stand@@ -up comic in the Arab world .
I never like to claim first , but I do know that they never heard that nasty little rum@@ or that women aren &apos;t funny , and they find us hy@@ ster@@ ical .
In 2003 , my brother from another mother and father Dean O@@ bei@@ d@@ all@@ ah and I started the New York Arab@@ -@@ American Comedy Festival , now in its 10th year .
Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab@@ -@@ Americans in media , while also remin@@ ding casting directors that South Asian and Arab are not syn@@ ony@@ mous .
Main@@ streaming Arab@@ s was much , much easier than con@@ qu@@ ering the challenge against the stigma against disability .
My big break came in 2010 .
I was invited to be a gu@@ est on the cable news show &quot; Coun@@ t@@ down With Keith Ol@@ ber@@ mann . &quot;
I walked in looking like I was going to the pro@@ m , and they shuff@@ le me into a studio and seat me on a spinning , rolling chair .
So I looked at the stage manager and I &apos;m like , &quot; Excuse me , can I have another chair ? &quot;
And she looked at me and she went , &quot; Five , four , three , two ... &quot;
And we were live , right ?
So I had to grip onto the anch@@ or &apos;s desk so that I wouldn &apos;t roll off the screen during the segment , and when the interview was over , I was li@@ vid .
I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it , and I knew I would never get invited back .
But not only did Mr. Ol@@ ber@@ mann invite me back , he made me a full-time contribut@@ or , and he tap@@ ed down my chair .
One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Ol@@ ber@@ mann was that humans on the Internet are sc@@ um@@ bags .
People say children are cruel , but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult .
Suddenly , my disability on the world wide web is fair game .
I would look at clips online and see comments like , &quot; Y@@ o , why &apos;s she twe@@ ak@@ in ? &quot;
&quot; Y@@ o , is she ret@@ ar@@ ded ? &quot;
And my favorite , &quot; Poor Gum@@ by-@@ mouth terrorist .
What does she suffer from ?
We should really pray for her . &quot;
One comm@@ enter even suggested that I add my disability to my credi@@ ts : scre@@ en@@ writer , com@@ edian , pal@@ sy .
Dis@@ ability is as visual as race .
If a wheelchair user can &apos;t play Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é , then Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é can &apos;t play a wheelchair user .
The disabled are the largest — Yeah , clap for that , man . C &apos;@@ mon .
People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world , and we are the most under@@ represented in entertainment .
The doctors said that I wouldn &apos;t walk , but I am here in front of you .
However , if I grew up with social media , I don &apos;t think I would be .
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life .
Perhaps if there were more positive images , it would foster less hate on the Internet .
Or maybe not .
Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well .
My cro@@ o@@ ked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places .
I got to walk the red carpet f@@ lan@@ ked by soap di@@ va Susan Lu@@ c@@ c@@ i and the iconic Lor@@ ra@@ ine Ar@@ bus .
I got to act in a movie with Adam Sand@@ ler and work with my i@@ do@@ l , the amazing Dave Matthe@@ ws .
I tou@@ red the world as a head@@ lin@@ er on Arab@@ s G@@ one W@@ ild .
I was a del@@ eg@@ ate representing the great state of New Jersey at the 2008 DN@@ C .
And I founded May@@ soon &apos;s Kids , a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children a sli@@ ver of the chance my parents gave me .
But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got -- before this moment -- — but the one moment that stands out the most was when I got to perform for the man who flo@@ ats like a butter@@ fly and st@@ ings like a bee , has Parkinson &apos;s and sha@@ kes just like me , Muhammad Ali .
It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live , and I dedic@@ ate this talk to his memory .
My name is May@@ soon Z@@ ay@@ id , and if I can can , you can can .
So , we used to solve big problems .
On July 21st , 1969 , Bu@@ z@@ z Al@@ drin climbed out of Apollo 11 &apos;s lun@@ ar mo@@ dule and desc@@ ended onto the Sea of Tran@@ qu@@ ility .
Armstrong and Al@@ drin were alone , but their presence on the moon &apos;s gray surface was the cul@@ min@@ ation of a con@@ vul@@ sive , collective effort .
The Apollo program was the greatest peace@@ time mobili@@ zation in the history of the United States .
To get to the moon , NASA spent around 180 billion dollars in today &apos;s money , or four percent of the federal budget .
Apollo employed around 400,000 people and dem@@ anded the collaboration of 20,000 companies , universities and government agencies .
People died , including the crew of Apollo 1 .
But before the Apollo program ended , 24 men flew to the moon .
T@@ wel@@ ve walked on its surface , of whom Al@@ drin , following the death of Armstrong last year , is now the most senior .
So why did they go ?
They didn &apos;t bring much back : 8@@ 41 pounds of old rocks , and something all 24 later emphas@@ ized -- a new sense of the small@@ ness and the fragi@@ lity of our common home .
Why did they go ? The cy@@ ni@@ cal answer is they went because President Kennedy wanted to show the Sovi@@ ets that his nation had the better rockets .
But Kennedy &apos;s own words at R@@ ice University in 1962 provide a better clue .
To con@@ tempor@@ aries , Apollo wasn &apos;t only a victory of West over East in the Cold War .
At the time , the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transc@@ end@@ ent powers of technology .
They went because it was a big thing to do .
Land@@ ing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s .
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane , pen@@ icillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis .
In the middle years of the century , polio was eradic@@ ated and smallpox eliminated .
Technology itself seemed to poss@@ ess what Al@@ vin T@@ off@@ ler in 1970 called &quot; acceler@@ ative thrust . &quot;
For most of human history , we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail , but in 1969 , the crew of Apollo 10 flew at 25,000 miles an hour .
Since 1970 , no human beings have been back to the moon .
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10 , and bli@@ the optimism about technology &apos;s powers has evapor@@ ated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve , such as going to Mars , creating clean energy , cur@@ ing cancer , or feeding the world have come to seem in@@ trac@@ t@@ ably hard .
I remember watching the lif@@ to@@ ff of Apollo 17 .
I was five years old , and my mother told me not to stare at the fier@@ y exhau@@ st of a Saturn V rocket .
I vag@@ u@@ ely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions , but I was absolutely certain there would be Mars colonies in my lifetime .
So &quot; Something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology &quot; has become a common@@ place .
You hear it all the time .
We &apos;ve heard it over the last two days here at TED .
It feels as if technologi@@ sts have diver@@ ted us and enri@@ ched themselves with trivial toys , with things like iPh@@ ones and apps and social media , or algorithms that speed autom@@ ated trading .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with most of these things .
They &apos;ve expanded and enri@@ ched our lives .
But they don &apos;t solve humanity &apos;s big problems .
What happened ?
So there is a par@@ och@@ ial explanation in Silicon Valley , which admit@@ s that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it finan@@ ced Intel , Microsoft , Apple and Gen@@ ent@@ ech .
Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame , in particular the incentives that venture capit@@ alists offer to entrepreneurs .
Silicon Valley says that venture investing shifted away from funding transforma@@ tional ideas and towards funding incre@@ mental problems or even fake problems .
But I don &apos;t think that explanation is good enough .
It mostly explains what &apos;s wrong with Silicon Valley .
Even when venture capit@@ alists were at their most ris@@ k-@@ happy , they preferred small investments , tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years .
V@@ .@@ C.@@ s have always struggled to invest profit@@ ably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and leng@@ thy , and V@@ .@@ C.@@ s have never , never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that poss@@ ess no immediate commercial value .
No , the reasons we can &apos;t solve big problems are more complicated and more profound .
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems .
We could go to Mars if we want .
NASA even has the out@@ line of a plan .
But going to Mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal , and that will never happen .
We won &apos;t go to Mars , because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on Earth .
Sometimes , we can &apos;t solve big problems because our political systems fail .
Today , less than two percent of the world &apos;s energy consumption der@@ ives from advanced , renewable sources such as solar , wind and bio@@ fuels , less than two percent , and the reason is purely economic .
Co@@ al and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind , and petro@@ le@@ um is cheaper than bio@@ fuels .
We want alternative energy sources that can compete on price . None exist .
Now , technologi@@ sts , business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and international tre@@ ati@@ es would sp@@ ur the development of alternative energy : mostly , a significant increase in energy research and development , and some kind of price on carbon .
But there &apos;s no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy policy or international tre@@ ati@@ es that reflect that consensus .
Sometimes , big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so .
Fam@@ ines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply .
But 30 years of research have taught us that fam@@ ines are political cris@@ es that cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ically affect food distribution .
Technology can improve things like crop y@@ ields or systems for stor@@ ing and transpor@@ ting food , but there will be fam@@ ines so long as there are bad governments .
Finally , big problems sometimes elu@@ de solution because we don &apos;t really understand the problem .
President Ni@@ xon declared war on cancer in 197@@ 1 , but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer , most of them fi@@ en@@ dis@@ h@@ ly resistant to therapy , and it is only in the last 10 years that effective , viable therapies have come to seem real .
H@@ ard problems are hard .
It &apos;s not true that we can &apos;t solve big problems through technology .
We can , we must , but these four elements must all be present : Poli@@ tical leaders and the public must care to solve a problem ; institutions must support its solution ; It must really be a technological problem ; and we must understand it .
The Apollo mission , which has become a kind of metaphor for technology &apos;s capacity to solve big problems , met these criteria .
But it is an irre@@ produ@@ ci@@ ble model for the future .
It is not 196@@ 1 .
There is no gal@@ van@@ izing contest like the Cold War , no politician like John Kennedy who can hero@@ ize the difficult and the dangerous , and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system .
Most of all , going to the moon turned out to be easy .
It was just three days away .
And argu@@ ably it wasn &apos;t even solving much of a problem .
We are left alone with our day , and the solutions of the future will be harder won .
God knows , we don &apos;t lack for the challenges .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;d like to invite you to close your eyes .
Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home .
I &apos;d like you to notice the color of the door , the material that it &apos;s made out of .
Now visualize a pack of over@@ weight nu@@ di@@ sts on bicycles .
They are competing in a naked bicycle race , and they are headed straight for your front door .
I need you to actually see this .
They are pe@@ d@@ aling really hard , they &apos;re swe@@ at@@ y , they &apos;re boun@@ cing around a lot .
And they crash straight into the front door of your home .
B@@ ic@@ y@@ cles fly everywhere , wheels roll past you , sp@@ okes end up in awkward places .
Step over the threshold of your door into your fo@@ yer , your hallway , whatever &apos;s on the other side , and appreciate the quality of the light .
The light is shining down on C@@ oo@@ k@@ ie Monster .
C@@ oo@@ k@@ ie Monster is wa@@ ving at you from his per@@ ch on top of a tan horse .
It &apos;s a talking horse .
You can practically feel his blue fur tick@@ ling your nose .
You can smell the o@@ at@@ meal rais@@ in cookie that he &apos;s about to sho@@ vel into his mouth .
Walk past him . Walk past him into your living room .
In your living room , in full imagin@@ ative broad@@ band , picture B@@ rit@@ ney Spe@@ ars .
She is sc@@ anti@@ ly cla@@ d , she &apos;s dancing on your coffee table , and she &apos;s singing &quot; H@@ it Me Baby One More Time . &quot;
And then follow me into your kitchen .
In your kitchen , the floor has been pa@@ ved over with a yellow brick road and out of your oven are coming towards you Dor@@ o@@ thy , the T@@ in Man , the S@@ car@@ ec@@ row and the L@@ ion from &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z , &quot; hand-@@ in-@@ hand ski@@ pping straight towards you .
Okay . Open your eyes .
I want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in New York City .
It &apos;s called the United States Mem@@ ory Champ@@ ion@@ ship .
And I had gone to cover this contest a few years back as a science journalist expecting , I guess , that this was going to be like the Super@@ bowl of savan@@ ts .
This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies , widely var@@ ying in both age and hy@@ gi@@ en@@ ic up@@ keep .
They were memor@@ izing hundreds of random numbers , looking at them just once .
They were memor@@ izing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers .
They were memor@@ izing entire poems in just a few minutes .
They were competing to see who could mem@@ orize the order of a shuff@@ led pack of playing cards the fastest .
I was like , this is unbelievable .
These people must be fre@@ aks of nature .
And I started talking to a few of the competitors .
This is a guy called Ed C@@ ook who had come over from England where he had one of the best trained memories .
And I said to him , &quot; Ed , when did you realize that you were a sav@@ ant ? &quot;
And Ed was like , &quot; I &apos;m not a sav@@ ant .
In fact , I have just an average memory .
Everybody who comp@@ etes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory .
We &apos;ve all trained ourselves to perform these utterly mira@@ cul@@ ous fe@@ ats of memory using a set of ancient techniques , techniques invented 2,@@ 500 years ago in Greece , the same techniques that C@@ ic@@ er@@ o had used to mem@@ orize his spee@@ ches , that medi@@ eval schol@@ ars had used to mem@@ orize entire books . &quot;
And I was like , &quot; Whoa . How come I never heard of this before ? &quot;
And we were standing outside the competition hall , and Ed , who is a wonderful , brilliant , but somewhat ec@@ cent@@ ric English guy , says to me , &quot; Josh , you &apos;re an American journalist .
Do you know B@@ rit@@ ney Spe@@ ars ? &quot;
I &apos;m like , &quot; What ? No . Why ? &quot;
&quot; Because I really want to teach B@@ rit@@ ney Spe@@ ars how to mem@@ orize the order of a shuff@@ led pack of playing cards on U.S. national television .
It will prove to the world that anybody can do this . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Well I &apos;m not B@@ rit@@ ney Spe@@ ars , but maybe you could teach me .
I mean , you &apos;ve got to start somewhere , right ? &quot;
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me .
I ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory , but also investigating it , trying to understand how it works , why it sometimes doesn &apos;t work and what its potential might be .
I met a host of really interesting people .
This is a guy called E.@@ P.
He &apos;s an am@@ nes@@ ic who had , very possibly , the very worst memory in the world .
His memory was so bad that he didn &apos;t even remember he had a memory problem , which is amazing .
And he was this incredibly tragic figure , but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are .
The other end of the spectrum : I met this guy .
This is Kim Pe@@ ek .
He was the basis for Du@@ stin Hoff@@ man &apos;s character in the movie &quot; R@@ ain Man . &quot;
We spent an afternoon together in the S@@ alt Lake City Public Library memor@@ izing phone books , which was sc@@ inti@@ ll@@ ating .
And I went back and I read a whole host of memory tre@@ ati@@ ses , tre@@ ati@@ ses written 2,@@ 000-@@ plus years ago in Latin in Anti@@ qu@@ ity and then later in the Middle A@@ ges .
And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff .
One of the really interesting things that I learned is that once upon a time , this idea of having a trained , discipl@@ ined , cultiv@@ ated memory was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today .
Once upon a time , people invested in their memories , in lab@@ ori@@ ously fur@@ nis@@ hing their minds .
Over the last few mill@@ en@@ ia we &apos;ve invented a series of technologies -- from the alphabet to the sc@@ roll to the co@@ dex , the printing press , photography , the computer , the smartphone -- that have made it progres@@ sively easier and easier for us to extern@@ alize our memories , for us to essentially outs@@ ource this fundamental human capacity .
These technologies have made our modern world possible , but they &apos;ve also changed us .
They &apos;ve changed us culturally , and I would argue that they &apos;ve changed us cogni@@ tively .
Having little need to remember anymore , it sometimes seems like we &apos;ve forgotten how .
One of the last places on Earth where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained , discipl@@ ined , cultiv@@ ated memory is at this totally sing@@ ular memory contest .
It &apos;s actually not that sing@@ ular , there are con@@ tests held all over the world .
And I was fascinated , I wanted to know how do these guys do it .
A few years back a group of researchers at University College London brought a bunch of memory champ@@ ions into the lab .
They wanted to know : Do these guys have brains that are somehow struc@@ turally , anatom@@ ically different from the rest of ours ?
The answer was no .
Are they smarter than the rest of us ?
They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests , and the answer was not really .
There was however one really interesting and telling difference between the brains of the memory champ@@ ions and the control subjects that they were comparing them to .
When they put these guys in an f@@ MRI machine , scanned their brains while they were memor@@ izing numbers and people &apos;s faces and pictures of snow@@ fla@@ kes , they found that the memory champ@@ ions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else .
Of note , they were using , or they seemed to be using , a part of the brain that &apos;s involved in spatial memory and navi@@ gation .
Why ? And is there something the rest of us can learn from this ?
The sport of competitive memor@@ izing is driven by a kind of arms race where every year somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly , and then the rest of the field has to play cat@@ ch@@ up .
This is my friend Ben Pri@@ d@@ more , three-@@ time world memory champion .
On his desk in front of him are 36 shuff@@ led packs of playing cards that he is about to try to mem@@ orize in one hour , using a technique that he invented and he alone has ma@@ stered .
He used a similar technique to mem@@ orize the precise order of 4,@@ 140 random binary digits in half an hour .
Yeah .
And while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competi@@ tions , everything , all of the techniques that are being used , ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elabor@@ ative en@@ coding .
And it &apos;s well illu@@ strated by a ni@@ f@@ ty paradox known as the B@@ aker / b@@ aker paradox , which goes like this : If I tell two people to remember the same word , if I say to you , &quot; Remember that there is a guy named B@@ aker . &quot;
That &apos;s his name .
And I say to you , &quot; Remember that there is a guy who is a b@@ aker . &quot;
And I come back to you at some point later on , and I say , &quot; Do you remember that word that I told you a while back ?
Do you remember what it was ? &quot;
The person who was told his name is B@@ aker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is that he is a b@@ aker .
Same word , different amount of remembering ; that &apos;s weird .
What &apos;s going on here ?
Well the name B@@ aker doesn &apos;t actually mean anything to you .
It is entirely un@@ te@@ thered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull .
But the common n@@ ou@@ n b@@ aker , we know bak@@ ers .
B@@ akers wear funny white hats .
B@@ akers have fl@@ our on their hands .
B@@ akers smell good when they come home from work .
Maybe we even know a b@@ aker .
And when we first hear that word , we start putting these associ@@ ational hoo@@ ks into it that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date .
The entire art of what is going on in these memory con@@ tests and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life is figuring out ways to transform capital B B@@ akers into lower@@ -@@ case B bak@@ ers -- to take information that is l@@ acking in context , in significance , in meaning and transform it in some way so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind .
One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this dates back 2,@@ 500 years to An@@ cient Greece .
It came to be known as the memory pal@@ ace .
The story behind its creation goes like this : There was a poet called Sim@@ oni@@ des who was atten@@ ding a ban@@ qu@@ et .
He was actually the hired entertainment , because back then if you wanted to throw a really sl@@ amm@@ ing party , you didn &apos;t hire a D.@@ J. , you hired a poet .
And he stands up , deli@@ vers his poem from memory , walks out the door , and at the moment he does , the ban@@ qu@@ et hall collap@@ ses , kills everybody inside .
It doesn &apos;t just kill everybody , it man@@ gles the bodies beyond all recognition .
Nobody can say who was inside , nobody can say where they were sitting .
The bodies can &apos;t be properly buried .
It &apos;s one tragedy com@@ po@@ unding another .
Sim@@ oni@@ des , standing outside , the sole survivor am@@ id the w@@ reck@@ age , clos@@ es his eyes and has this realization , which is that in his mind &apos;s eye , he can see where each of the gu@@ ests at the ban@@ qu@@ et had been sitting .
And he takes the relatives by the hand and gui@@ des them each to their loved ones am@@ id the w@@ reck@@ age .
What Sim@@ oni@@ des figured out at that moment is something that I think we all kind of intui@@ tively know , which is that , as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers and wor@@ d-@@ for-@@ word instructions from our colleagues , we have really excep@@ tional visual and spatial memories .
If I asked you to re@@ count the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Sim@@ oni@@ des , chances are you would have a tough time with it .
But I would w@@ ager that if I asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse in your fo@@ yer right now , you would be able to see that .
The idea behind the memory pal@@ ace is to create this imagined edi@@ f@@ ice in your mind &apos;s eye and pop@@ ulate it with images of the things that you want to remember -- the cra@@ zi@@ er , weir@@ der , more bizarre , fun@@ ni@@ er , ra@@ un@@ ch@@ ier , stin@@ k@@ ier the image is , the more un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able it &apos;s likely to be .
This is advice that goes back 2,@@ 000-@@ plus years to the earliest Latin memory tre@@ ati@@ ses .
So how does this work ?
Let &apos;s say that you &apos;ve been invited to TED center stage to give a speech and you want to do it from memory , and you want to do it the way that C@@ ic@@ er@@ o would have done it if he had been invited to TED@@ x@@ Rome 2,000 years ago .
What you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house .
And you &apos;d come up with some sort of an absolutely crazy , ridiculous , un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able image to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest .
And then you &apos;d go inside your house , and you would see an image of C@@ oo@@ k@@ ie Monster on top of M@@ ister Ed .
And that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed C@@ ook .
And then you &apos;d see an image of B@@ rit@@ ney Spe@@ ars to remind you of this funny anec@@ dote you want to tell .
And you go into your kitchen , and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year , and you have some friends to help you remember that .
This is how Roman or@@ ators memor@@ ized their spee@@ ches -- not wor@@ d-@@ for-@@ word , which is just going to screw you up , but top@@ ic@@ -@@ for-@@ topic .
In fact , the phrase &quot; topic sentence , &quot; that comes from the Greek word &quot; top@@ os , &quot; which means &quot; place . &quot;
That &apos;s a vest@@ ige of when people used to think about or@@ atory and rhetor@@ ic in these sorts of spatial terms .
The phrase &quot; in the first place , &quot; that &apos;s like in the first place of your memory pal@@ ace .
I thought this was just fascinating , and I got really into it .
And I went to a few more of these memory con@@ tests .
And I had this notion that I might write something longer about this sub@@ culture of competitive memor@@ iz@@ ers .
But there was a problem .
The problem was that a memory contest is a path@@ ologically boring event .
Tru@@ ly , it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the S@@ AT@@ s .
I mean , the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts mas@@ sa@@ ging their tem@@ ples .
And I &apos;m a journalist , I need something to write about .
I know that there &apos;s this incredible stuff happening in these people &apos;s minds , but I don &apos;t have access to it .
And I realized , if I was going to tell this story , I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit .
And so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sat down with my New York Times just trying to remember something .
Maybe it was a poem .
Maybe it was names from an old year@@ book that I bought at a fle@@ a market .
And I found that this was sho@@ ck@@ ingly fun .
I never would have expected that .
It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory .
What you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re trying to get better and better and better at creating , at dreaming up , these utterly lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous , ra@@ un@@ chy , hil@@ ari@@ ous and hopefully un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able images in your mind &apos;s eye .
And I got pretty into it .
This is me wearing my standard competitive memor@@ izer &apos;s training kit .
It &apos;s a pair of ear@@ mu@@ ffs and a set of safety go@@ ggl@@ es that have been m@@ asked over except for two small pin@@ holes , because distra@@ ction is the competitive memor@@ izer &apos;s greatest enemy .
I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier .
And I had this notion that I might enter it , sort of as an experiment in partici@@ pat@@ ory journalism .
It &apos;d make , I thought , maybe a nice ep@@ il@@ og@@ ue to all my research .
Problem was the experiment went ha@@ y@@ wire .
I won the contest , which really wasn &apos;t supposed to happen .
Now it is nice to be able to mem@@ orize spee@@ ches and phone numbers and shopping lists , but it &apos;s actually kind of beside the point .
These are just tricks .
They are tricks that work because they &apos;re based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work .
And you don &apos;t have to be building memory pal@@ aces or memor@@ izing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works .
We often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an inn@@ ate gift , but that is not the case .
Great memories are learned .
At the most basic level , we remember when we pay attention .
We remember when we are deeply engaged .
We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience and figure out why it is meaningful to us , why it is significant , why it &apos;s colorful , when we &apos;re able to transform it in some way that it makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds , when we &apos;re able to transform B@@ akers into bak@@ ers .
The memory pal@@ ace , these memory techniques , they &apos;re just short@@ cuts .
In fact , they &apos;re not even really short@@ cuts .
They work because they make you work .
They force a kind of depth of processing , a kind of mind@@ fulness , that most of us don &apos;t normally walk around exercis@@ ing .
But there actually are no short@@ cuts .
This is how stuff is made memor@@ able .
And I think if there &apos;s one thing that I want to leave you with , it &apos;s what E.@@ P. , the am@@ nes@@ ic who couldn &apos;t even remember that he had a memory problem , left me with , which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories .
How much are we willing to lose from our already short lives by losing ourselves in our Black@@ ber@@ ries , our iPh@@ ones , by not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us , by being so lazy that we &apos;re not willing to process deeply ?
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capac@@ ities lat@@ ent in all of us .
But if you want to live a memor@@ able life , you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember .
Thank you .
When I was 27 years old , I left a very demanding job in management consul@@ ting for a job that was even more demanding : teaching .
I went to teach seventh gra@@ ders math in the New York City public schools .
And like any teacher , I made qu@@ iz@@ zes and tests .
I gave out homework assign@@ ments .
When the work came back , I calculated grades .
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students .
Some of my strongest per@@ formers did not have strat@@ osp@@ heric I.Q. scores .
Some of my smar@@ test kids weren &apos;t doing so well .
And that got me thinking .
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math , sure , they &apos;re hard : rati@@ os , dec@@ im@@ als , the area of a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
But these concepts are not impossible , and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough .
After several more years of teaching , I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motiv@@ ational perspective , from a psychological perspective .
In education , the one thing we know how to measure best is I.Q. , but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily ?
So I left the classroom , and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist .
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings , and in every study my question was , who is successful here and why ?
My research team and I went to West Point Milit@@ ary Academy .
We tried to predict which ca@@ de@@ ts would stay in military training and which would drop out .
We went to the National Sp@@ elling Be@@ e and tried to predict which children would advance far@@ th@@ est in competition .
We studied ro@@ ok@@ ie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods , asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year , and of those , who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students ?
We partner@@ ed with private companies , asking , which of these sal@@ es@@ people is going to keep their jobs ?
And who &apos;s going to earn the most money ?
In all those very different contexts , one characteristic emerged as a significant predic@@ tor of success .
And it wasn &apos;t social intelligence .
It wasn &apos;t good looks , physical health , and it wasn &apos;t I.Q.
It was gr@@ it .
Gr@@ it is passion and per@@ sever@@ ance for very long-term goals .
Gr@@ it is having stam@@ ina .
Gr@@ it is sticking with your future , day in , day out , not just for the week , not just for the month , but for years , and working really hard to make that future a reality .
Gr@@ it is living life like it &apos;s a marathon , not a spr@@ int .
A few years ago , I started studying gr@@ it in the Chicago public schools .
I asked thousands of high school j@@ uni@@ ors to take gr@@ it question@@ n@@ air@@ es , and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate .
Turns out that grit@@ tier kids were significantly more likely to graduate , even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure , things like family income , standar@@ dized achievement test scores , even how safe kids felt when they were at school .
So it &apos;s not just at West Point or the National Sp@@ elling Be@@ e that gr@@ it matters . It &apos;s also in school , especially for kids at risk for dropping out .
To me , the most shocking thing about gr@@ it is how little we know , how little science knows , about building it .
Every day , parents and teachers ask me , &quot; How do I build gr@@ it in kids ?
What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic ?
How do I keep them motivated for the long run ? &quot;
The honest answer is , I don &apos;t know .
What I do know is that talent doesn &apos;t make you gri@@ tty .
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commit@@ ments .
In fact , in our data , gr@@ it is usually un@@ related or even in@@ ver@@ sely related to measures of talent .
So far , the best idea I &apos;ve heard about building gr@@ it in kids is something called &quot; growth mindset . &quot;
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol D@@ w@@ eck , and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed , that it can change with your effort .
Dr. D@@ w@@ eck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge , they &apos;re much more likely to per@@ severe when they fail , because they don &apos;t believe that failure is a permanent condition .
So growth mindset is a great idea for building gr@@ it .
But we need more .
And that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to end my re@@ marks , because that &apos;s where we are .
That &apos;s the work that stands before us .
We need to take our best ideas , our strongest intui@@ tions , and we need to test them .
We need to measure whether we &apos;ve been successful , and we have to be willing to fail , to be wrong , to start over again with lessons learned .
In other words , we need to be gri@@ tty about getting our kids grit@@ tier .
Thank you .
My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions .
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this .
Both projects are in emerging countries , one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia .
And also they have in common that the different analy@@ ses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture .
The first example started with an invitation to design a multi@@ story shopping mall in Ethiopia &apos;s capital city A@@ dd@@ is Ab@@ aba .
And this is the type of building we were shown as an example , to my team and myself , of what we had to design .
At first , the first thing I thought was , I want to run away .
After seeing a few of these buildings -- there are many in the city -- we realized that they have three very big points .
First , these buildings , they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things .
Second , they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside , and then you need a lot of cooling .
In a city where this shouldn &apos;t happen because they have really mild weather that ran@@ ges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year .
And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia .
It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions .
Also during our first visit to Ethiopia , I was really cap@@ tiv@@ ated by the old merk@@ ato that is this open-@@ air structure where thousands of people , they go and buy things every day from small v@@ end@@ ors .
And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the out@@ doors to create activity .
So I thought , this is what I really want to design , not a shopping mall .
But the question was how we could do a multi@@ story , contemporary building with these principles .
The next challenge was when we looked at the site , that is , in a really growing area of the city , where most of these buildings that you see in the image , they were not there .
And it &apos;s also between two parallel streets that don &apos;t have any connection for hundreds of meters .
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets , putting all the entran@@ ces of the building .
And this exten@@ ds with an incl@@ ined at@@ ri@@ um that creates an open-@@ air space in the building that self-@@ prot@@ ects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain .
And around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops , that change in each floor because of the shape of the void .
I also thought , how to close the building ?
And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions .
And I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with per@@ for@@ ations that would let the air in , and also the light , but in a fil@@ tered way .
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful buttons of the Ethiop@@ ian women &apos;s d@@ resses .
That they have frac@@ tal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole fac@@ ade .
And we are building that with these small pre@@ fabri@@ cated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building .
And this is comple@@ mented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night .
With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like , &quot; This is not a shopping mall . We didn &apos;t ask for that . &quot;
But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell .
And also that the idea of the fac@@ ade was much , much cheaper , not only because of the material compared with the glass , but also because we didn &apos;t need to have air conditioning anymore .
So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project .
And the first imple@@ mentation was to think about how we could make the building self-@@ sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day .
So we created a huge asset by placing photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics there on the roof .
And then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban o@@ asis .
And these por@@ ches on the roof , all together they collect the water to re@@ use for sanitation on the inside .
Hopefully by the beginning of next year , because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction .
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tun@@ is .
And for doing such a big project , the biggest project I &apos;ve ever designed , I really needed to understand the city of Tun@@ is , but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture .
During that analysis I paid special attention to the med@@ ina that is this 1,@@ 000-@@ year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall , opened by t@@ wel@@ ve different gates , connected by almost straight lines .
When I went to the site , the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets , creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Bar@@ cel@@ ona and other cities in Europe with these cour@@ ty@@ ards .
On top of that , we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines , and this modified this initial pattern .
And the last operation was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , like the apartment , as an essential part of the master plan .
And for that I thought , what would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment ?
And it &apos;s nor@@ th-@@ south , because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural venti@@ lation .
So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction .
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city .
It has these blocks with cour@@ ty@@ ards , and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestri@@ ans .
And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor .
And it also rein@@ forces this idea of the gates .
The volume has this connecting shape that sha@@ des itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the cour@@ ty@@ ards there are the different facilities , such as a gy@@ m and a kindergarten and close by , a series of commercial &#91; spaces &#93; that bring activity to the ground floor .
The roof , which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction .
And it &apos;s where all the neighbors , they can go up and soci@@ alize , and do activities such as having a two-@@ kilometer run in the morning , jumping from one building to another .
These two examples , they have a common approach in the design process .
And also , they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing .
In these cities , the impact of architecture in people &apos;s lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow .
For this reason , I see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people .
Thank you very much .
So I &apos;m going to talk about trust , and I &apos;m going to start by remin@@ ding you of the standard views that people have about trust .
I think these are so common@@ place , they &apos;ve become c@@ lich@@ és of our society .
And I think there are three .
One &apos;s a claim : there has been a great decline in trust , very widely believed .
The second is an aim : we should have more trust .
And the third is a task : we should rebuild trust .
I think that the claim , the aim and the task are all mis@@ conceived .
So what I &apos;m going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim , an aim and a task which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter .
First the claim : Why do people think trust has decl@@ ined ?
And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence , I don &apos;t know the answer .
I &apos;m incl@@ ined to think it may have decl@@ ined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others .
I don &apos;t have an over@@ view .
But , of course , I can look at the opinion poll@@ s , and the opinion poll@@ s are supp@@ os@@ edly the source of a belief that trust has decl@@ ined .
When you actually look at opinion poll@@ s across time , there &apos;s not much evidence for that .
That &apos;s to say , the people who were mist@@ ru@@ sted 20 years ago , princip@@ ally journalists and politicians , are still mist@@ ru@@ sted .
And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago are still rather highly trusted : judges , nurses .
The rest of us are in between , and by the way , the average person in the street is almost exactly mid@@ way .
But is that good evidence ?
What opinion poll@@ s record is , of course , opinions .
What else can they record ?
So they &apos;re looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions .
Do you trust politicians ? Do you trust teachers ?
Now if somebody said to you , &quot; Do you trust green@@ gro@@ cers ?
Do you trust fis@@ h@@ mon@@ gers ?
Do you trust elementary school teachers ? &quot;
you would probably begin by saying , &quot; To do what ? &quot;
And that would be a perfectly sensible response .
And you might say , when you understood the answer to that , &quot; Well , I trust some of them , but not others . &quot;
That &apos;s a perfectly rational thing .
In short , in our real lives , we seek to place trust in a differenti@@ ated way .
We don &apos;t make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or offic@@ e-@@ hol@@ der or type of person is going to be uniform .
I might , for example , say that I certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to teach the recep@@ tion class to read , but in no way to drive the school mini@@ bus .
I might , after all , know that she wasn &apos;t a good driver .
I might trust my most lo@@ qu@@ acious friend to keep a conversation going but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret .
Simple .
So if we &apos;ve got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differenti@@ ated , why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstra@@ ctly ?
I think the poll@@ s are very bad gui@@ des to the level of trust that actually exists , because they try to ob@@ liter@@ ate the good judgment that goes into placing trust .
Secondly , what about the aim ?
The aim is to have more trust .
Well frankly , I think that &apos;s a stupid aim .
It &apos;s not what I would aim at .
I would aim to have more trust in the trust@@ worthy but not in the un@@ trust@@ worthy .
In fact , I aim posi@@ tively to try not to trust the un@@ trust@@ worthy .
And I think , of those people who , for example , placed their savings with the very ap@@ tly named Mr. Ma@@ do@@ ff , who then made off with them , and I think of them , and I think , well , yes , too much trust .
More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life .
Intelli@@ gently placed and intelligent@@ ly refused trust is the proper aim .
Well once one says that , one says , yeah , okay , that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
It &apos;s jud@@ ging how trust@@ worthy people are in particular respects .
And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things .
Are they competent ? Are they honest ? Are they reliable ?
And if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters , and reliable and honest , we &apos;ll have a pretty good reason to trust them , because they &apos;ll be trust@@ worthy .
But if , on the other hand , they &apos;re un@@ reliable , we might not .
I have friends who are competent and honest , but I would not trust them to post a letter , because they &apos;re for@@ get@@ ful .
I have friends who are very confident they can do certain things , but I realize that they over@@ estimate their own compet@@ ence .
And I &apos;m very glad to say , I don &apos;t think I have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dis@@ honest .
If so , I haven &apos;t yet spot@@ ted it .
But that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking for : trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess before trust .
Trust is the response .
Tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess is what we have to judge . And , of course , it &apos;s difficult .
Ac@@ ross the last few decades , we &apos;ve tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
A lot of these systems have the con@@ verse effect .
They don &apos;t work as they &apos;re supposed to .
I remember I was talking with a mid@@ wife who said , &quot; Well , you see , the problem is it takes longer to do the paper@@ work than to deliver the baby . &quot;
And all over our public life , our institutional life , we find that problem , that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess and evidence of trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess is actually doing the opposite .
It is distra@@ cting people who have to do difficult tasks , like mid@@ wives , from doing them by requ@@ iring them to tick the boxes , as we say .
You can all give your own examples there .
So so much for the aim .
The aim , I think , is more trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess , and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trust@@ worthy and communicate our trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess to other people , and if we are trying to judge whether other people or offic@@ e-@@ hol@@ ders or politicians are trust@@ worthy .
It &apos;s not easy . It is judgment , and simple reaction , attitudes , don &apos;t do adequ@@ ately here .
Now thirdly , the task .
C@@ alling the task re@@ building trust , I think , also gets things backwards .
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust .
Well , we can do that for ourselves .
We can rebuild a bit of trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust .
But trust , in the end , is distinctive because it &apos;s given by other people .
You can &apos;t rebuild what other people give you .
You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust .
So you have to , I think , be trust@@ worthy .
And that , of course , is because you can &apos;t fool all of the people all of the time , usually .
But you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trust@@ worthy .
How to do it ?
Well every day , all over the place , it &apos;s being done by ordinary people , by officials , by institutions , quite effectively .
Let me give you a simple commercial example .
The shop where I buy my so@@ cks says I may take them back , and they don &apos;t ask any questions .
They take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of so@@ cks of the color I wanted .
That &apos;s super . I trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me .
I think there &apos;s a big lesson in that .
If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party , then that is very good evidence that you are trust@@ worthy and you have confidence in what you are saying .
So in the end , I think what we are aim@@ ing for is not very difficult to disc@@ ern .
It is relationships in which people are trust@@ worthy and can judge when and how the other person is trust@@ worthy .
So the moral of all this is , we need to think much less about trust , let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis@@ -@@ detected by opinion poll@@ s , much more about being trust@@ worthy , and how you give people adequate , useful and simple evidence that you &apos;re trust@@ worthy .
Thanks .
You know , my favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch .
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids , and when my daughter was four , we got to watch &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; together .
It totally dominated her imagination for months .
Her favorite character was G@@ lin@@ da , of course .
It gave her a great excuse to wear a spar@@ k@@ ly dress and carry a wand .
But you watch that movie enough times , and you start to realize how unusual it is .
Now we live today , and are raising our children , in a kind of children &apos;@@ s-@@ fantas@@ y-@@ spectac@@ ul@@ ar-@@ industrial complex .
But &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; stood alone .
It did not start that trend .
For@@ ty years later was when the trend really caught on , with , interestingly , another movie that fe@@ at@@ ured a metal guy and a fur@@ ry guy rescu@@ ing a girl by d@@ ressing up as the enemy &apos;s guards .
Do you know what I &apos;m talking about ?
Yeah .
Now , there &apos;s a big difference between these two movies , a couple of really big differences between &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; and all the movies we watch today .
One is there &apos;s very little violence in &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z . &quot;
The monkeys are rather aggressive , as are the apple trees .
But I think if &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; were made today , the wi@@ z@@ ard would say , &quot; Dor@@ o@@ thy , you are the sa@@ vi@@ or of O@@ z that the proph@@ ec@@ y for@@ et@@ old .
Use your magic sli@@ ppers to defeat the computer-@@ generated arm@@ ies of the W@@ icked Wit@@ ch . &quot;
But that &apos;s not how it happens .
Another thing that &apos;s really unique about &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even vil@@ la@@ in@@ ous characters are female .
Now I started to notice this when I actually showed &quot; Star Wars &quot; to my daughter , which was years later , and the situation was different .
At that point I also had a son .
He was only three at the time .
He was not invited to the screening . He was too young for that .
But he was the second child , and the level of super@@ vision had plum@@ met@@ ed .
So he wander@@ ed in , and it im@@ printed on him like a mom@@ my duck does to its du@@ ck@@ ling , and I don &apos;t think he understands what &apos;s going on , but he is sure so@@ aking in it .
And I wonder what he &apos;s so@@ aking in .
Is he picking up on the themes of courage and per@@ sever@@ ance and loy@@ alty ?
Is he picking up on the fact that Luke jo@@ ins an army to over@@ throw the government ?
Is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for A@@ unt Ber@@ u , and of course this prin@@ cess , who &apos;s really cool , but who kind of wa@@ its around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a me@@ dal and a win@@ k to thank him for saving the universe , which he does by the magic that he was born with ?
Comp@@ are this to 193@@ 9 with &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z . &quot;
How does Dor@@ o@@ thy win her movie ?
By making friends with everybody and being a leader .
That &apos;s kind of the world I &apos;d rather raise my kids in -- O@@ z , right ? -- and not the world of du@@ des fighting , which is where we kind of have to be .
Why is there so much Force -- capital F , Force -- in the movies we have for our kids , and so little yellow brick road ?
There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the bo@@ y-@@ violent movie has on girls , and you should do that reading . It &apos;s very good .
I haven &apos;t read as much on how boys are picking up on this vi@@ be .
I know from my own experience that Prin@@ cess Lei@@ a did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navi@@ gating the adult world that is co-@@ ed .
I think there was a first-@@ kiss moment when I really expected the credi@@ ts to start rolling because that &apos;s the end of the movie , right ?
I finished my quest , I got the girl .
Why are you still standing there ?
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m supposed to do .
The movies are very , very focused on defe@@ ating the vil@@ la@@ in and getting your reward , and there &apos;s not a lot of room for other relationships and other jour@@ neys .
It &apos;s almost as though if you &apos;re a boy , you are a dop@@ ey animal , and if you are a girl , you should bring your warrior co@@ stu@@ me .
There are plenty of exceptions , and I will defend the Disney prin@@ cess@@ es in front of any you .
But they do send a message to boys , that they are not , the boys are not really the target audience .
They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patri@@ archy , but they are not necessarily showing boys how they &apos;re supposed to defend against the patri@@ archy .
There &apos;s no models for them .
And we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids , and as three-dimensional and del@@ ight@@ ful as Her@@ mi@@ one and Kat@@ nis@@ s are , these are still war movies .
And , of course , the most successful studio of all time continues to c@@ rank out classic after classic , every single one of them about the journey of a boy , or a man , or two men who are friends , or a man and his son , or two men who are raising a little girl .
Until , as many of you are thinking , this year , when they finally came out with &quot; Bra@@ ve . &quot;
I recommend it to all of you . It &apos;s on demand now .
Do you remember what the cri@@ tics said when &quot; Bra@@ ve &quot; came out ?
&quot; A@@ w , I can &apos;t believe Pix@@ ar made a prin@@ cess movie . &quot;
It &apos;s very good . Don &apos;t let that stop you .
Now , almost none of these movies pass the Be@@ ch@@ del Test .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard of this .
It has not yet caught on and caught fire , but maybe today we will start a movement .
Ali@@ son Be@@ ch@@ del is a comic book artist , and back in the mid@@ - &apos; 80s , she recorded this conversation she &apos;d had with a friend about ass@@ essing the movies that they saw .
And it &apos;s very simple . There &apos;s just three questions you should ask : Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines ?
So try to meet that bar .
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie ?
And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like ?
Right ? Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff .
It does happen . I &apos;ve seen it , and yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love .
In fact , this week I went to see a very high-quality movie , &quot; Ar@@ go . &quot;
Right ? Oscar buz@@ z , doing great at the box office , a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is .
It pretty much fl@@ unks the Be@@ ch@@ del test .
And I don &apos;t think it should , because a lot of the movie , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve seen it , but a lot of the movie takes place in this em@@ bassy where men and women are hiding out during the ho@@ stage crisis .
We &apos;ve got quite a few scenes of the men having deep , ang@@ st-@@ ri@@ dden conversations in this hi@@ de@@ out , and the great moment for one of the ac@@ tr@@ esses is to pe@@ ek through the door and say , &quot; Are you coming to bed , honey ? &quot;
That &apos;s Hollywood for you .
So let &apos;s look at the numbers .
2011 , of the 100 most popular movies , how many of them do you think actually have female pro@@ tagon@@ ists ?
Ele@@ ven . It &apos;s not bad .
It &apos;s not as many percent as the number of women we &apos;ve just elected to Congress , so that &apos;s good .
But there is a number that is greater than this that &apos;s going to bring this room down .
Last year , The New York Times published a study that the government had done .
Here &apos;s what it said .
One out of five women in America say that they have been sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted some time in their life .
Now , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the fault of popular entertainment .
I don &apos;t think kids &apos; movies have anything to do with that .
I don &apos;t even think that music videos or porno@@ graphy are really directly related to that , but something is going wrong , and when I hear that statistic , one of the things I think of is that &apos;s a lot of sexual as@@ sail@@ ants .
Who are these guys ? What are they learning ?
What are they failing to learn ?
Are they absor@@ bing the story that a male hero &apos;s job is to defeat the vil@@ la@@ in with violence and then collect the reward , which is a woman who has no friends and doesn &apos;t speak ?
Are we so@@ aking up that story ?
You know , as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing , we find this world and this statistic very al@@ ar@@ ming and we want to prepare them .
We have tools at our dispos@@ al like &quot; girl power , &quot; and we hope that that will help , but I gotta wonder , is girl power going to protect them if , at the same time , actively or passi@@ vely , we are training our sons to maintain their boy power ?
I mean , I think the Netflix queu@@ e is one way that we can do something very important , and I &apos;m talking mainly to the da@@ ds here .
I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of man@@ hood .
The definition of man@@ hood is already turning upside down .
You &apos;ve read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregi@@ ver and wage ear@@ ner .
They &apos;re throwing it up in the air .
So our sons are going to have to find some way of adap@@ ting to this , some new relationship with each other , and I think we really have to show them , and model for them , how a real man is someone who tru@@ sts his sisters and respects them , and wants to be on their team , and stands up against the real bad guys , who are the men who want to abuse the women .
And I think our job in the Netflix queu@@ e is to look out for those movies that pass the Be@@ ch@@ del Test , if we can find them , and to seek out the hero@@ ines who are there , who show real courage , who bring people together , and to nu@@ dge our sons to identify with those hero@@ ines and to say , &quot; I want to be on their team , &quot; because they &apos;re going to be on their team .
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in &quot; Star Wars , &quot; do you know what she said ?
O@@ bi@@ -@@ W@@ an .
O@@ bi@@ -@@ W@@ an Ken@@ ob@@ i and G@@ lin@@ da .
What do these two have in common ?
Maybe it &apos;s not just the spar@@ k@@ ly dress .
I think these people are experts .
I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else , and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential .
Now , they are leaders .
I like that kind of quest for my daughter , and I like that kind of quest for my son .
I want more quest@@ s like that .
I want fewer quest@@ s where my son is told , &quot; Go out and fight it alone , &quot; and more quest@@ s where he sees that it &apos;s his job to join a team , maybe a team led by women , to help other people become better and be better people , like the W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z .
Thank you .
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid .
I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story .
He lives in a small village in southern Somalia .
His village is near M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u .
Dr@@ ought drives the small village into poverty and to the br@@ ink of star@@ vation .
With nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u , the capital of Somalia .
When he arri@@ ves , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .
He ends up living in a tent city on the outs@@ k@@ irts of M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u .
Maybe a year passes , nothing .
One day , he &apos;s approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast .
He meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
He &apos;s given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes , money to send back home to his family .
He is introduced to this young woman .
He eventually gets married .
He starts this new life .
He has a purpose in life .
One beautiful day in M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u , under an az@@ ure blue sky , a car bomb goes off .
That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bom@@ ber , and that dynamic group of people were al S@@ hab@@ a@@ ab , a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda .
So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up ?
He was waiting .
He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along .
This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call wai@@ thood .
And his story repe@@ ats itself in urban centers around the world .
It is the story of the dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ ised , unemployed urban youth who spar@@ ks riots in Johann@@ es@@ burg , spar@@ ks riots in London , who reaches out for something other than wai@@ thood .
For young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities .
Often it &apos;s youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates .
By 2030 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of wai@@ thood , the g@@ ate@@ way to terrorism , to violence , to gangs , will be the story of cities 2.0 .
And in my city of birth , M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment .
70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school .
They pretty much do nothing .
I went back to M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u last month , and I went to visit Mad@@ ina Hospital , the hospital I was born in .
I remember standing in front of that bul@@ let@@ -@@ ri@@ dden hospital thinking , what if I had never left ?
What if I had been forced into that same state of wai@@ thood ?
Would I have become a terrorist ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
My reason for being in M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit .
I brought together about 90 young Som@@ ali leaders .
We sat down and brain@@ stor@@ med on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
One of the young men in the room was A@@ den .
He went to university in M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u , graduated .
There were no jobs , no opportunities .
I remember him telling me , because he was a college graduate , unemployed , frustrated , that he was the perfect target for al S@@ hab@@ a@@ ab and other terrorist organizations , to be recruited .
They sought people like him out .
But his story takes a different route .
In M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u , the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads .
Twenty-@@ three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system , and a motor@@ bike can be the easiest way to get around .
A@@ den saw an opportunity and sei@@ zed it .
He started a motor@@ bike company .
He began r@@ enting out motor@@ bikes to local residents who couldn &apos;t normally afford them .
He bought 10 bikes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years .
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to identify and sei@@ ze a new opportunity .
It &apos;s entrepreneurship , and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against wai@@ thood .
It em@@ powers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking .
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
I want to talk to you about a young man who atten@@ ded one of my meetings , Moh@@ amed Moh@@ am@@ oud , a flor@@ ist .
He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship .
He &apos;s actually the first flor@@ ist M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u has seen in over 22 years , and until recently , until Moh@@ amed came along , if you wanted flowers at your wedding , you used plastic b@@ ou@@ qu@@ ets shipped from abroad .
If you asked someone , &quot; When was the last time you saw fresh flowers ? &quot; for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; Never . &quot;
So Moh@@ amed saw an opportunity .
He started a landsc@@ ap@@ ing and design fl@@ oral company .
He created a farm right outside of M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u , and started growing tu@@ lips and li@@ lies , which he said could survive the harsh M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u climate .
And he began delivering flowers to we@@ dd@@ ings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u &apos;s first public park in 22 years .
There &apos;s no public park in M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u .
He wants to create a space where families , young people , can come together , and , as he says , smell the pro@@ ver@@ bial ros@@ es .
And he doesn &apos;t grow ros@@ es because they use too much water , by the way .
So the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , Moh@@ amed &apos;s presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room .
They had never really thought about starting up a business .
They &apos;ve thought about working for an NGO , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .
By the end of the day , they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city .
They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems .
So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step , but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality .
They need expertise and ment@@ or@@ ship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses .
Connec@@ t young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ide@@ ation to creation , and you will create cataly@@ sts for urban growth .
For me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business .
It &apos;s about creating a social impact .
Moh@@ amed is not simply selling flowers .
I believe he is selling hope .
His Peace Park , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city .
A@@ den hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him .
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of wai@@ thood .
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
So my suggestion is , turn youth into entrepreneurs , incu@@ b@@ ate and nurture their inherent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and wai@@ thood .
Thank you .
When I was a child growing up in Maine , one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the se@@ ash@@ ores of Maine , because my parents told me it would bring me luck .
But you know , these shells , they &apos;re hard to find .
They &apos;re covered in sand . They &apos;re difficult to see .
However , over@@ time , I got used to looking for them .
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them .
This grew into a passion for finding things , a love for the past and archae@@ ology .
And eventually when I started studying Egyp@@ t@@ ology , I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn &apos;t enough .
Because all of the sudden in Egypt my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine to one eight hundred miles long next to the N@@ ile , and my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities .
This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery .
For trying to map the past , I knew that I had to see differently .
So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared .
This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian del@@ ta called Ben@@ di@@ x .
And the site visi@@ bly appears brown , but when we use the infrared and we process it , all of the sudden , using false color , the site appears as bright pink .
What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptians .
What I want to share with you today is how we &apos;ve used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city , called It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y , missing for thousands of years .
It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y was ancient Egypt &apos;s capital for over four hundred years , at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom about four thousand years ago .
The site is located in the Fa@@ i@@ y@@ um of Egypt and site is really important because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great ren@@ aissance for ancient Egyptian art , architecture and religion .
Egyp@@ t@@ ologists have always known the site of It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y was located somewhere near the pyrami@@ ds of the two kings who built it , indic@@ ated within the red circles here , but somewhere within this massive flood plane .
This area is huge -- it &apos;s four miles by three miles in size .
The N@@ ile used to flow right next to the city of It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y , and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east , it covered over the city .
So , how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape ?
Fin@@ ding it randomly would be the equivalent of loc@@ ating a needle in a ha@@ yst@@ ack , blin@@ d@@ folded wearing baseball mit@@ ts .
So what we did is we used NASA top@@ ography data to map out the landscape , very subtle changes .
We started to be able to see where the N@@ ile used to flow .
But you can see in more detail -- and even more interesting -- this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here , which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y .
So we collabor@@ ated with the Egyptian scientists to do cor@@ ing work , which you see here .
When I say cor@@ ing , it &apos;s like ice cor@@ ing , but instead of layers of climate change you &apos;re looking for layers of human occupation .
And five meters down , underneath a thick layer of mud , we found a dense layer of pot@@ tery .
What this shows is that at this possible location of It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y , five meters down , we have of layer of occupation for several hundred years dating to the Middle Kingdom , dating to the exact period of time we think It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y is .
We also found work stone -- car@@ nel@@ ian , quar@@ tz and ag@@ ate that shows that there was a jewel@@ ers workshop here .
These might not look like much , but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom , these are the stones that were used .
So , we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site .
We also have evidence of an elite jewel@@ ers workshop , showing that whatever was there was a very important city .
No It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y was here yet , but we &apos;re going to be returning to the site in the near future to map it out .
And even more importantly , we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well .
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom -- it was probably written at the city of It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y four thousand years ago .
&quot; Shar@@ ing knowledge is the greatest of all call@@ ings .
There &apos;s nothing like it in the land . &quot;
So as it turns out , TED was not founded in 1984 A@@ D .
Ma@@ king ideas actually started in 1984 BC at a not-@@ lo@@ st-@@ for-@@ long city , found from above .
It certainly puts finding se@@ ash@@ ells by the se@@ ash@@ ore in perspective .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Gro@@ wing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a cal@@ li@@ grap@@ her , one of my most treas@@ ured memories was my mother showing me the beauty , the shape and the form of Chinese characters .
E@@ ver since then , I was fascinated by this incredible language .
But to an out@@ sider , it seems to be as imp@@ en@@ et@@ r@@ able as the Great Wall of China .
Over the past few years , I &apos;ve been wondering if I can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so .
I started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning Chinese might be useful .
Since the age of five , I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence .
I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
Since we only have five minutes , it &apos;s better that we have a fast and simpler way .
A Chinese schol@@ ar would understand 20,000 characters .
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy .
The top 200 will allow you to compreh@@ end 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read road signs , restaurant men@@ us , to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers .
Today I &apos;m going to start with eight to show you how the method works .
You are ready ?
Open your mouth as wide as possible until it &apos;s square .
You get a mouth .
This is a person going for a walk .
Person .
If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides , as if she was y@@ elling fran@@ tically , &quot; Help ! I &apos;m on fire ! &quot; -- This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the fl@@ ame , but I like to think that way . Whi@@ ch@@ ever works for you .
This is a tree .
T@@ ree .
This is a mountain .
The sun .
The moon .
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of sal@@ oon doors in the wild west .
I call these eight characters radic@@ als .
They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
A person .
If someone walks behind , that is &quot; to follow . &quot;
As the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crowd .
If a person stretched their arms wide , this person is saying , &quot; It was this big . &quot;
The person inside the mouth , the person is trapped .
He &apos;s a prisoner , just like Jon@@ ah inside the whale .
One tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have the woods .
Three trees together , we create the forest .
Put a pl@@ ank underneath the tree , we have the foundation .
Put a mouth on the top of the tree , that &apos;s &quot; idi@@ ot . &quot;
E@@ asy to remember , since a talking tree is pretty idi@@ otic .
Remember fire ?
Two fires together , I get really hot .
Three fires together , that &apos;s a lot of fl@@ ames .
S@@ et the fire underneath the two trees , it &apos;s burning .
For us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
Two s@@ uns together , prosper@@ ous .
Three together , that &apos;s spar@@ kles .
Put the sun and the moon shining together , it &apos;s bri@@ ght@@ ness .
It also means tomorrow , after a day and a night .
The sun is coming up above the horizon . Sun@@ rise .
A door . Put a pl@@ ank inside the door , it &apos;s a door bol@@ t .
Put a mouth inside the door , asking questions .
Kno@@ ck knock . Is anyone home ?
This person is sne@@ aking out of a door , escap@@ ing , ev@@ ading .
On the left , we have a woman .
Two women together , they have an argument .
Three women together , be careful , it &apos;s adul@@ tery .
So we have gone through almost 30 characters .
By using this method , the first eight radic@@ als will allow you to build 32 .
The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32 .
So with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a Chinese eight-@@ year-old .
So after we know the characters , we start building phrases .
For example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire mountain . It &apos;s a volcano .
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun .
This is a sun placed with the origin , because Japan lies to the east of China .
So a sun , origin together , we build Japan .
A person behind Japan , what do we get ?
A Japanese person .
The character on the left is two mountains st@@ acked on top of each other .
In ancient China , that means in ex@@ ile , because Chinese emper@@ ors , they put their political enemies in ex@@ ile beyond mountains .
No@@ wadays , ex@@ ile has turned into getting out .
A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit .
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage . Thank you .
